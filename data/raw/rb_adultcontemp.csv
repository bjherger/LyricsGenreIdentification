It's just one of dem days, when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of dem days, don't take it personal
It's just one of dem days, and you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong but I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love, you're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave, and baby trust me please

Just one of dem days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside, don't want to take it out on to you
Just one of dem days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

I sit and think about every thing we do
And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really want to be with you the whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused

As I swing back mood to mood it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure, so won't you understand
That I'm only in love, you're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me boy, so baby don't you leave

Just one of dem days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside, don't want to take it out on to you
Just one of dem days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

Just one of dem days, that a girl goes through

Four

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet

Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jumped yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel

I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby, you know the deal
'Cause she bad so maybe she won't, uh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah

Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now
She will, she will, she will

Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now
She will, she will, she will, uh
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now
She will, she will

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back

Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that wine and dine

Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say choose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off

Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split, uh

No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?

If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't want to forget the present is a gift
And I don't want to take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day 
here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for

When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day 
here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Can you do that for me baby?

Every time you touch me
See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know

Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me

Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me

Not again
Oh this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Kanye West]
Keep rockin and keep knockin'
Whether you're Louie Vuittonin' it up, or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they serving on a plater
So what we gon have dessert or disaster?

[Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking about our life, our house and kids (Yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down (knocked me down)

[Chorus]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)

[Ne-Yo]
I never thought I hear myself say
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm going to kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander-in-chief for my pimp ship flying high
Till i met this pretty little missile, who shot me out the sky

So now I'm crashing don't know how it happened
but i know it feels so damn good
Said if i could go back and make it happen faster
don't you know i would baby if i could
Miss independent, to the fullest, the load never too much
she helping me pull it, she shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
girl sometimes love

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)

[Kanye West]
Tell me now can you it make past your caspers
So we could finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
to seem to only date the head of football teams,
and i was the class clown that always kept you laughing
we were never meant to be, baby we just happened
so please don't mess up the trick,
hey young world, i'm the new slick rick,
they say i move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us,
let the hour glass pass right into ashes
let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
so i wrote this love letter right before my classes
how could a goddess ask someone that's only average, for advice
o-m-g you listen to that bitch?
woah is me, baby this is tragic
cause we had it, we was magic
i was flying, now i'm crashing
this is bad, real bad, michael jackson
now i'm mad, real mad, joe jackson
you should leave your boyfriend now, i'ma ask him

[Keri Hilson]
so you gotta take the good with the bad, the happy and the sad
or will you bring the better future then i had in the past
cause i don't want to make the same mistakes i did
i don't wanna fall back on my face again
woah, woah
i'll admit it, i was scared to answer loves call
woah, woah
and if it hits, better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (comes around)
and it knocks you down
just get back up
when it knocks you down (knocks you down)

Won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love comes knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now

Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
It never was for me, (no not really)
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy, you bring me joy, you bring me joy

I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so, so anticipating
Girl, I didn't know I had love inside of me

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

I never thought that I could love a girl the way I do
Oh boy, my my my my boy
I'm so glad that I found your love too

When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

I've got the Rolly on my arm
And I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat

The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit
Trying to ask me shit

When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four B
And think before you fuck wit lil' skateboard P

When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya

I've got the Rolly on my arm
And I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

I'm a gangsta but y'all knew that
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
Two, one, yep, three
S N, double O, P D O, double G

I can't fake it, just break it and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live

So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya

And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

I'm a Bad Boy wit a lotta ho's
Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp

On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun so you wanna pop back?
AK47 now nigga, stop that

C mid shoes, now, I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now, you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you

Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to
Subscribe nigga, get yo issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose

When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
A beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
It may be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you feel
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of this straight line

There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escape them one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie

You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember, do you remember?

The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember, do you remember
The times of your life? (do you remember?)

Reach out for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
The mem'ries are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the saddest part (comes the saddest part)
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may

Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember, will you remember
The times of your life?



Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember, will you remember
The times of your life?

Gonna dial my heart

Watch out

I've been sitting here
Trying to figure out
How she does it to me

I don't understand how
She takes her man and
Changes his personality

She rocks it to the east
She rocks it to the west
I need some time cause
My head is such a mess

I know she's crazy 'bout me too
It's ridiculous, baby
I don't know what to do

You've got me going
Crazy, crazy, crazy
You've got me going
Crazy, crazy, baby

Check it out

Okay
Told you 'bout a
Girl that's so funky
Can't you see
She's got me going
Showing the moves
I've never been shown

She's got us all whipped
Even my little brother
Yo, word to your mother

You know what, when
She's around, I feel shaky
Yo, she got us all going crazy

I'm a different man
Doing the best I can
Keeping my sanity

You know, babe
She knows the way
I feel for her
Word to my mother

She rocks me to the east
She rocks me to the west
Slow down, baby
I got pains in my chest

Don't fight this feeling
You know you want me too
Don't play games with me, baby
I ain't got time to lose, sing

[Repeat CHORUS]

Rocks me out of my mind

[Repeat CHORUS]

Yo, Keem, take it to the bridge

Finally we can walk
We can talk on this bridge
Bridge of love
On this bridge of love
We can work it out

Crazy for your love
Crazy for you
Crazy for your love
Crazy for you

Hoo, I'm crazy
Ho, I'm crazy
Ho, I'm crazy
Crazy, crazy, baby

Going out of my mind

You've got me going crazy
Stop wasting my time
Crazy, crazy
I've been going crazy since
You came in my life

You've got me going crazy
Why can't you see
What you do to me
Crazy, baby
I can't eat, can't sleep
Tell me what could it be

Crazy for your love
Crazy for you

Boy, This evening, was it only me,
Feeling completely
Down to be open.
Down to be open,
For some satisfaction.
Didn't wanna say yes,
Afraid of your reaction.
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way,
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date.
Couldn't let go,
It stayed on my mind.
At the end of the night,
I had to decide,
I was thinking.

(Chorus)
I should make a move but I won't.
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong.
Knowing if I do that it won't be right.
I don't get down on the first night.
I should make a move but I won't.
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong.
Knowing if I do that it won't be right.
I wanna get down but not the first night.

We were chillin,
Watching your TV.
I thought you were coming close as you got to me.
Wanted to touch you.
Wanted to kiss you.
And somehow in one night,
Discover I love you.
Felt so right but it felt so wrong,
And look how we are carrying on.
Try to say things to get me to stay,
But my watch tells me its getting to late.
I'm thinking.

(Chorus)
I should make a move but I won't.
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong.
Knowing if I do that it won't be right.
I don't get down on the first night.
I should make a move but I won't.
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong.
Knowing if I do that it won't be right.
I wanna get down but not the first night.

If,
If you want me,
You got to know me.
If you want my love,
You gotta win my love.
Hey baby,
That's the way its got to be yeah.
Get to know me.
Get to know me.
So we can do this.

I should make a move but I won't.

Knowing if I do that it won't be right.

My life is brilliant.
My love is pure.
I saw an angel.
Of that I'm sure.
She smiled at me on the subway.
She was with another man.
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
'Cause I've got a plan.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw your face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.
Yes, she caught my eye,
As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I
was,
Flying high.
And I don't think that I'll see her
again,
But we shared a moment that will
last 'til the end.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw your face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
There must be an angel with a smile
on her face,
When she thought up that I should
be with you.

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing I've ever seen
But oh, no, no, she gotta man and a son though
But that's okay 'cause I
Wait for my cue and just listen play my position like
A short stop, pick up everything mommy hittin'
And in no time, I'm gonna make this friend mine
And that's for sure
'Cause I, I never been the type to break-up a happy home
But somethin' 'bout baby gurl, I just can't leave alone

The way you come through and holla
And swoop me in his two-seater

Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it
But it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But you and me got ties for different reasons
I respect that

Shorty in the drop top V made a right
Pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice
Jumped out the whip like I was the police

And a big body sittin' on them gleamy things

Cop them mo chicks
Cop mo bricks, pop mo Cris

Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo'
Ride whips, hittin' chicks

I've imagined faces of many lovers
To ease the pain of having no one
In My Life.
And i'm tried of being undercover...
It's time to Navigate my feelings tonight...

Hook:
The sky is calm
The stars are bright.
What's better than to be in flight.
I'll relax my mind
And be at ease...
and let this journey
Set me free
Set me free.

Chrous:

I'll Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)
To a place. that I long for.
And my heart will be... the pathway.


I'm searching for a love
That 's ever more...

I've oftened wondered how'd i managed.
Always seraching, but, not finding a true heart.
What does it take to find me a lover.
I'm hoping that I dont' have to fly.

I'll relax my mind and be at ease.
and let this journey set me free
Set me free...

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire

A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game

and maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart I'll pretend

Come back again
I want you to stay next time
'Cause sometimes the world ain't kind
When people get lost like you and me
I just made a friend
A friend is someone you need
But now that he had to go away
I still feel the words that he might say

Turn on your Heartlight
Let it shine whereever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

Turn on your Heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon
You and me

He's lookin' for home
'Cause everyone needs a place
And home's the most excellent place of all
And I'll be right here if you should call me

Let it shine whereever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

They get mad seein' somethin' they had and sombody else is holdin'
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
These wicked women, ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door

Hear the one about Tina, some say she's much too loose
That came straight from a guy who claims he's tastin' her juice
Hear the one about Michael, some say he must be gay
I try to argue, but they said if he was straight he wouldn't move that way
Hear the one about Susan, some say she's just a tease
In a camisole she's six feet tall, she'll knock you to your knees

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door

I can't go no place without somebody pointin' a finger
I can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors I'm a dead ringer
It seems from rumors I just can't get away
I bet there'll even be rumors floatin' around on Judgment Day
I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors, shoot to kill

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day

How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said good-bye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?

I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart

Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

chorus
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love everyday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

chorus

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

chorus

ad lib:
Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home
Hey yea
He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you

Ooh, you walk out on me

'cause to reason is not what you care for.

I've heard it all a million times before.
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door.

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.

then you take it apart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated.

You don't realize
that it's all compromise
and the problems are so over-rated.

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show.

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
""All you need is love""

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago.

(All those years ago)

(All those years ago)

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears

And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me

until that first hello, until that first smile

You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Girl your everything a man could want and more
one thousand words are not enough
to say what i feel inside
holding hands as we walk along the shore
never felt like this before,
now your all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
there's beauty up above

You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast
The love I have for you
Time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end
Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget.

But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be

penny lover, don't you make me cry
can't you see girl, who my heart's beating for
you're the only girl that i adore
The first time i saw you

one day you'd be mine
honey you came along and captured my heart
now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss

And I know, I know they've all been talkin' about me
I can hear them whisper, and it makes me think
There must be somethin' wrong with me

I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain, 'til the sun shined through
I'd try to deny it but I'm still in love with you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy

No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you
I can see the love shining in your eyes
And it comes as such a sweet surprise
If seeing's believing, it's worth the wait
So, hold me and tell me, it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you baby

A love like ours will never end, just touch me and we're there again
Just one night and we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do
Hold on tight and whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through
If seeing's believing, it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me, it's not too late
We're so good together, we're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do there's just no getting over you
And I miss you, I miss you, all the tender love you gave me
(Baby, baby)

When a feeling gets this strong, you know the real thing come along
And I miss you, I miss you like crazy, baby
Only your sweet love can save me

Any day it could get too rough
Now I'm glad I kept holding on
Now I'm glad I had soul enough

You turned night into day
And showed me how my soul could sing
You took my hurt away
And showed me love conquers anything

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I got it right
Holding on, every day and every night
Holding on, hold on

Fall asleep in your lover's arms
And it's just like it ought to be
Just be thankful she keeps you warm
In a world where there's nothing free

Give her love every day
And pay attention when she dreams
And she'll be good to you
'Cause sometimes love is just what it seems

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I got it right
Holding on, every day and every night
Holding on, hold on

See the mountain water
Keeps flowing down into streams
Now it holds on forever
We'll be holding on forever, forever

People soul searching all night long
For a reason to help them live
And I do hope they hear the song
Take and you get to give

It can be in a smile
It can be there in a touch
It warms the world a while
When it's love it can't be too much

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I got it right
Holding on, every day and every night
Holding on, hold on

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I got it right
Holding on, every day, every night

Neil Diamond

When the night returns just like a friend
When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day
Make peaceful sounds in me
Took a drag from my last cigarette
Took a drink from a glass of old wine
I closed my eyes, and I could make it real
And feel it one more time

Can you hear it, babe
Can you hear it, babe
From another time
From another place
Do you remember it, babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean

Here's to the songs we used to sing
And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again
But hard to let them go

Do you hear it, babe
Do you hear it, babe
It was another time
It was another place
Do you remember it, babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.008975983,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/fRDCpqDXeXRn1A+oeHiqWnTqlX+cYIuL4G4WVfmBoOJ07ayM+ZGY2RymPPMaa02uWSp8r5RuuTGcWnXoPFYZ2o/LEeR05ZKR5Ak52gBh1kKdRX9pdeJcvVH0VIYJhcmzSUXeZ6GLJz+Sh+XSI0oIdbGfbdyLzXObGBO/4XlYsO2YJlZ4UMTZbUtMrEDo+d09OnwaRNXR+znl61Kqxq7XSrP389wVnqcrhTcD2c9Cj+n/R6ev/hhDkkuI80RO4aHPjVxVdyrzqpJKlDcffjPvgpVV1jVYzcE/o69xZrxYBgezWuwRNS+Hobw2pMKf3oCW7fH4Av5Zlbso1E7+PQ1yb/SXdL6rRqw2hVx8tFDviIRM0I/Vid3m9bNYrLOdsLK+LyK+oy+KzMOSusEhCCAZuKLiD6TPYM6Y70qo7sW5jU0=/,1001783.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/UE24I3EVUIWcbN0RRAojsiystAnf98J7Xzv+QSTI81dDwlOMnZf2YbRlOno9iIt8mFBCdzi58iGd251OOUE0IdsL5L4kyMxJk+LjUgVgrg/zFYBSxUlS6QBx35XqFRAsn1W0w6asX1pesUbgmOgoe1kRTJBgEmHAYpW0Aph6dflx/xIfaHwsuWwzjNR3CfDOiXI/Wt26MtPSWWrC96NmK5A+6cEkp9MmSADDK8NvNxtplOqg9GblZ5XZl/d+Q5jNF6Lrq/kT2fadUY81CqETCSVYpEagPWwooM/P+/p1tAmaLsfee7siln82GXIa0dOVSGxoXm+JlKQoLsM8K5CYWnsYBufSf+C6Xs3zdD+8xy+VtpuLGNjsSntfOW2kLu2JYInKwCWWnDjJBJChD3jHUn3g228SipoV++j2H2wHnz4=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:59:21 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Tv9T1RQy1ec2o0lR91grsBBiLOLSLBY3TyH9q8RrRqztRyAItpc+hJeAz65HxeH7XRD2hqm3enkpd3Rn/ApVWq7wYm84+veE8aZm/uu/VWn8EZCpUTxFkTGfFzXXmCtxXR76EImM2Z52nuEcN0oDFPhLfu8Ok9TegKrgTsYLH6aOicPUdO/utUrA2OhDNenfLeAebtk0vq23ZNq/g7sX8VS4DcBAWG7xbw2pc+hxDOKLMmgfeMnZaWx1mLKZLNhu4uZtH4JYDqmZg011dR0ppy1bsD4HnZ5qd5vV8IcQLMONpbPBTnhDd420bvbIbJeKH0adX3BgrrpGGKPn4uI6PsGX0hehbikdl1Es33KeQtH+A7TkKnGArQ9sv0fF4S9jA5QR1/WVOmGcAIxpVzVYF/8rYmhxS3ds+BnG3c8UBpU=/,200.0,2011-08-22T14:11:50Z,[],if you know what i mean,1976

Put on your red dress
And slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume
It sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick
Let your hair down
Cause Baby when you get through

Tonight will be a special night
No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just wanna let you know

You got my saying

And your so damn fine

Yeah...
Uh huh
So seductive

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin 'til you hit the spot (whoa)
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (whoa)

You can have it your way, how do you want it
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it
Temperature risin, okay let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nypmho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental,
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha)

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin 'til you hit the spot (whoa)

I'll take you to the candy shop
With one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (whoa)

Girl what we do (what we do)
And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you (oh yeah)

Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin, homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin 'til you hit the spot (whoa)

I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (whoa)


I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep goin 'til you hit the spot (whoa)

I'll take you to the candy shop

Can't believe you called my home

Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

We will even fall in love
And we will be together in any kind of weather
Just like that, just like that

Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

You must've put a thing on me
Because there are no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy

And you can rest easy, I've got your back
You'll never have to feel no pain
'Cause I dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

(That's right)
Control
(Career moves)

Control
(I do what's right for me)
Control
(And me wants to groove, is that okay?)
Yeah, ooh, control

I've got my own mind, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions

When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control
Hop to it, I'm in control
And I love it, ha, ha, ha, that's right

Control
(Now I've got a lot)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up, ah)

I'm in control, uh
I'm in control, ah
I'm in control, uh
Don't make me lose it

She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

I feel so lost, don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend, I never would have thought it could be
You were someone, someone I really thought I could trust
But my man you laid and I'm betrayed

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

Thicker than blood, wherever there was me, there was you
My all was your all but that wasn't enough for you
You had to see and tried to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, in my bed, betrayed by my best friend

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

Why? Why? Why? Why?

Hov!
Uh huh, Hov'
You, are, not, ready
Hov', unstoppable, Dynasty, young Hova

I'm a hustler baby [I'm a hustler]
I just want you to know [Wanna let you know]
It aint where I been [It aint where I been]
But where I'm bout to go [Top of the world!]
Now I just wanna love you [just wanna love you]
But be who I am [you know you love me]
And with all this cash [mo' money, mo' problems]
You'll forget your man
Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin it for karats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

I just want you to know [Hov']
It aint where I been
But where I'm bout to go [Hov', Hov']
Now I just wanna love you [young Hova]
But be who I am [know you love me]
And with all this cash [mo' money, mo' problems]
You'll forget your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Got some hot chocolate on the stove waiting for you
Listen first things first let me hang up the coat
Yeah how was your day today? Did you miss me? You did? Yeah? I missed you too
I missed you so much I followed you today
That's right now close your mouth 'cause you cold busted
That‰Ûªs right, now sit down here, sit down here
I'm so upset with you I don't know what to do
My first impulse was to run up on you and do a Rambo
Whip out the Jammy and flat blast both of you
But I ain't wanna mess up this thirty-seven hundred dollar lynx coat
So instead I chilled -- That's right chilled
Then I went up the bank‰Û_ took out every dime.
And then I went and canceled all those credit cards, yeah
All your charge accounts, yeah
I stuck you up for every piece of jewelry I ever bought you!
Yeah that‰Ûªs right, everything, everything,
Don't go lookin' in that closet 'cause you ain‰Ûªt got nuthin‰Ûª in there
Everything you came here with is packed up and waiting for you in the guest room.
That‰Ûªs right, what was you thinking about, huh
What you trying to prove, huh? This is the Juice!
I gave you silk suits, Gucci handbags, blue diamonds.
I gave you things you couldn't even pronounce, but now I can't give you nothing but advice.
But you're still young, yeah that‰Ûªs right, you're still young.
I hope you learn a valuable lesson from this, you know
And you're gonna find somebody like me one of these days‰Û_
Until then, you know what you gotta do?
You gotta get on outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, Hush-Puppy-shoe-wearing crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!
That's right, Silly rabbit, tricks are made for kids, don't you know that.
You without me like corn flake without the milk!
This is my world. You're just a squirrel trying to get a nut!
Now get on outta here. Scat!

A chance that you might love me too
(Love me too)

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, to never, never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

(For I never knew the art of making love)
(Though my heart aches with love for you)
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too
(Love me too)

Oh, you give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never, never know

Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to ""Mary Lou"", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck

But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well

Cannot live apart

But I can't stop

Don't be a fool
Haven't we already broken every rule

We can't say goodbye

No sacrifice would ever be too great
If you would just stay

When I think of making up
Plans to let you go
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
I'm gonna let you know
But when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only love I ever knew
Every time I think of you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

My heart's been hurting
When I see you flirting
Every night out on the floor
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
You'l grow to love me more
But whenever we're together
I could leave you never
Even though you treat me cruel
Every time I look at you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

I tried to resist you
When you're gone, all I ever do is miss you
Anyone in love would know
Anyone with half a heart
Could never let you go

(instrumental)

But when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only girl I ever loved
Can't you tell me why do you hurt me
I guess some people never see
Especially a fool like me

My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

If you get what I get what would you say
She wax it all off, Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari

Better cuff your chick if you with her
I can get her

I aint really mean to say on my d-ck
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it

Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When your doing that thing over there, homie
Lets go

Cause I feel like I‰Ûªm running
And I‰Ûªm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don‰Ûªt and I won‰Ûªt ever stop cause
You know I gotta win everyday day, goooo
See they don‰Ûªt really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky, nooo
You aint never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a n-gga gotta set it then I got it going
Then I gotta get it, than I gotta blow, than I shut it any little thing
That a n-gga think he be doing cause it doesnt matter cause I‰Ûªm gonna dead it
Then I‰Ûªm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, and make it clearer to a couple n-ggas
That I‰Ûªm always winning and I gotta get it again and again and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A n-gga better call a ref, everybody know my style
And n-gga‰Ûªs know that I‰Ûªm the the best
When I come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east and I bang in the west
And I come to give you more and I never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know whats next, lets go
See the way we on, we be all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don‰Ûªt try to keep up with the pace
We struggling and hustling and sending in and getting in
And always gotta take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it

Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, p-ssy juicy
I never gave a f-ck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You n-ggas aint eatin, f-ck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em, and I said ‰ÛÏok‰Û
If on that bullshit then I‰Ûªm like ‰ÛÏole‰Û,

Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That‰Ûªs word to my flag, and my flag red
I‰Ûªm out of my head, bitch I‰Ûªm outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter at mine, nope, not on my time and I‰Ûªm not even trying
Whats poppin Slime? nothin five, and if they trippin f-ck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive, these n-ggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight, since guiding light, and my pockets white and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy‰Ûªs dead
You faggots scared cause I‰Ûªm too wild, been here for a while
I was like f-ck trial, I puts it down

That your the kind of guy that I should make a move on

I could be wrong, but I feel like something could be going on

There ain't no other for me it's only you

I wanna be down

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of

If all you need is my time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call me baby
I wanna stay by your side, be there to cool you out
And let you know everything will be all right

All the lovin' you gave me
The feelings we shared
And I still can remember
How your touch was so tender
It told me you cared

We had a once in a lifetime
But I just couldn't see
Until' it was gone
A second once in a lifetime
May be too much to ask
But I swear from now on

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

Now I'm seen clearly
How I still need you near me
I still love you so
There's something between us
That won't ever leave us
There's no letting go
(No letting go)

We had a once in a lifetime
But I just didn't know it
'Til my life fell apart
A second once in a lifetime
Isn't too much to ask
'Cause I swear from the heart

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end, never end

The best of romances
Deserve second chances
I'll get to you somehow
'Cause I promise now

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time

I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me, well well

I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so clear

Last night, you bought something special
Out of me, ooh wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality, indeed

I never thought love was meant for me
I was blind and could not see, well well
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so sincere

You've got me thinking that I need protection
'Cause your love is so strong, I don't wanna do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true protection
You just give me a call and I'll give you my all

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of

I feel nice

Intoxicated
Flying high

But I like the way I feel

When I rise
You are the first thing

And in the middle
Of the night

But I like the way I feel

Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away,

I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowing what to do

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Turning back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call living is just being satisfied
With knowing I got no one left to blame

Carefree highway, got to see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or trying to get free
From the good old faithful feeling we once knew

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you
Let me slip away on you

You like that, huh?
Remember me?
Let's get roudy
Let's ride
Yeah, yeah
Yo, Montell when you walk
They be goin' to the lobby ya'll
Tell the bellman I need some more towels up here
When you see shorty?
The one that's sittin on them 20's?
Tell him in 504 she's still 'bout me, you heard?
Let's get roudy

You know Montell's 'bout it, 'bout it
Master P's 'bout it, 'bout it

Stepped in the club
After my show
You know the spot
Where everybody's on the low low
That's when I saw her
She saw me
She told me she like Master P
And Montell occassionally
So I laid back
Put a $50 in my mouth
Said I wanna see you shake it girl
Cuz that's what that 'bout it, 'bout it's about
All the nigga's in the club
Was jealous of me
Cuz I waited for it and I stayed for
And I'm damn near 'bout to pay for it
So

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

Let's Ride
Tonight
Can't do without it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I won't deny, babe
Girl I wanna ride it

Now baby what's more than incredible
She did her thing
5'5"" 146, Swinging nothing but a g-string
Her chocolate lips and
Sexy thighs
Sittin' properly up on top of me
She's riding, ain't no stopping me now
She bounced back
Then rocked slow
Like she's auditioning to kick it in my video
There ain't no limit
To what she'd do
I'm listening, she's whispering
Her girl wanna ride me too

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

She's moving up and down
And round and round tonight
Moving up and down
And around and around
She's moving up and down
And round and round, let's ride
Oh baby ain't nothing like the real thing

See us soldiers do it wild
I could make you smile
Make my nine go pow
Put on your boots let's run some miles
Camouflage on them sheets
Make that head board squeak
Up and down 'till you weak
Cuz us thug like a feak
Sixty eight will be my code
If you 'bout it girl, let's roll
I told you was no limit
Cuz tonight anything goes

Anything goes, let's roll
Lemme help you take up off your clothes
Give me a preview before
And the rest after the show
Thug love mixed with cream
Hennessey, strawberries, and Moet
Champagne, mo' in the bath havin' a hot tub
Drop a foot off a Oriental Rug
Can't get enough
You on top of me
Me on top of you
Do what you want to this thug
Girl ain't no stopping you

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

Coming to breakfast
Go tomorrow
Yeah, I'm coming wit you
Me and Silkk, fool

Told ya'll there wasn't no limit

Remember...
Ohhh, I remember...
I wanna know...

(Verse 1:)
Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you.
Thinking of all the times we shared.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

(Verse 2:)
No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart it just, it kept telling me so.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.


I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

(Bridge:)
There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life, I promised myself I will love me first genuinely.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
Sad and lonely.

I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
So sad and lonely, hey.
I remember when I stormed out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.

My lucky charm

Out on the street, friends are sayin'
They see what a change you've made in me
And they wonder why there's a smile on my face
They're gonna be in love one day, they'll see

With you liftin' me, I'm walking on air
And when you hold my hand I don't ever care
Don't need a four leaf clover or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
She's my lucky charm

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm

Well... my girl's the best, she gives me luck
When I'm feelin' down she cheers me up
When I see her my feelings rise
Ooh, girl, you hypnotize
Twinkle, twinkle little star
Lucky is what you are
With long dark hair and big brown eyes
She's like a leprechaun in disguise

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
She's my lucky charm

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm

Don't need a four leaf clover or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me
Don't know what you do to make me feel so well
You must be an angel with a magic spell

She's mine, mine all mine
She's mine, mine all mine

Don't need a four leaf clover or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me
Don't know what you do to make me feel so well

Into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
Was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

So I'll taste every moment

Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground

i feel so far away from where i've been
i got my eggs, and my pancakes too
i got my maple syrup, everything but you
i break the yolks and make a smiley face
i kinda like it in my brand new place
i wipe the spots off of the mirror
don't leave the keys in the door
i never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
1-dreams last so long, even after you're gone
i know, you love me
and soon you will see, you were meant for me
and i was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
so i picked up a paper, it was more bad news
more hearts being broken or people being used
put on my coat in the pouring rain
i saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'cause it was happy and i was sad
it made me miss you oh so bad
(repeat 1)
I go about my business, i'm doing fine
besides, what would i say if i had you on the line
same old story, not much to say
hearts are broken every day
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
i know you hate it, when i leave the light on
i pick up a book, and turn the sheets down
and take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead
i try and tell myself it'll be all right

Can't you see,

Every time you go away 
you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away 
you take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel yor body move
It doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on sayin' the same thing
Just can't you see, 
we've got everything do you even know we know

Every time you go away 
you take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away 
you take a piece of me with you


Can't go on singing the same theme

It aint where I been [It aint where I been]
But where I'm bout to go [Top of the world!]
Now I just wanna love you [just wanna love you]

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Let's keep it real ma, you savin it for karats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!

So that when the music plays I don't go back to the days
When love was you and me

Means that I love you so
Moja droga jacie kocham
More than you'll ever know
Kocham ciebie calem serce
Love you with all my heart
Return to me and always be
My melody of love

Wish I had a place to hide all my sorrow, all my pride
I just can't get along
'cause the love once so fine keeps on hurtin all the time
where did I go wrong?

they have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
they're just thorns without the rose
be careful of them in the dark

oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

on a downtown train
I know your window and i know its late
i know your stairs and your doorway
i walk down your street and past your gate
i stand by the light of the four way
and watch them as they fall, oh baby
they all having their heart attacks
they stay at the carnival
but they'll never win you back

you leave me lonely

When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What'do I do?

With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time

We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say

No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What'do I do?

I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
Cause I know how you feel
What a woman can do

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again...

Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said, ""No""
But I found out darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by you will get to know me
A little more better, girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid to let your feelings show
And I understand but girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

No way, no how I swear

No way, no how I

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie...

He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back to you,
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong?

Somewhere along in the bitterness

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me?

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine‰ÛÓI know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's Cheer Captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me?

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

*Instrumental*

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me?

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?

You belong with me.

The moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me
Which I couldn't see
And then
The moment I met you again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so
It couldn't be no
But try
As hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say, to me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair

Clair
If ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you
In all that you do
But why
In spite of our age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
""I'm going to marry you, will you marry me, Uncle Ray?""
Oh, Clair
Clair

Clair
I've told you before, don't you dare
Get back into bed
Can't you see that it's late
No you can't have a drink
Oh all right then, but wait just a bit
While I, in an effort to babysit
Catch of my breath what there is left of it
You can be murder at this hour of the day
But in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away

One day there'll be no remnants, no trace,
No residual feelings within you
One day you won't remember me.

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love you.
I hope you feel the same.

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affection
Had to fill out my prescription for the remedy
I had to set you free.

Away from me
To see clearly
The way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to live
I had to live
I had to leave
I had to leave

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into ""like""
Baby believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies.
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times
Better days, and I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally

Good bye, my love.
And you'll be on your way.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, I'll be all alone.

Any day now, when your restless eyes meets someone new,
Oh, to my sad surprise,
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down.

I know I shouldn't want to keep you,
If you don't want to stay,
Until you're gone forever,
I'll keep holding on for dear life.

Holding you this way,
Begging you to stay,
Any day now, when the clock strikes go, you'll call it off.
Then my tears will flow.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, love will let me down.
Cause you won't be around.

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

But you will see, it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seem so uptight
But nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on with my man
People out there can understand

I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true
You tell me what does it mean

Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight
Nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His lovin' will send me on and on with my man
People out there can you understand

Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

Givin' him somethin' he can feel
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
Givin' him somethin' he can feel

Save Your Kisses For Me
SAVE YOUR KISSES FOR ME - 1976
(Lee Sheriden/Martin Lee/Tony Hiller)
BROTHERHOOD OF MAN


Although it hurts to go away it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (i love you) you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do

Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (i love you) all the while
With your cute little away will you promise that you'll save

Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Going to walk out this door but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me save all your kisses for me
So long honey so long hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay 'cause you know I'll have to say
That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with you
I love you (i love you) it's true
You're so cute honey gee won't you save them up for me

Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Going to walk out this door but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me save all your kisses for me
So long honey so long hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay 'cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three

WRITERS LES REED, JACKIE RAE

I walk along empty streets,
And night becomes another dawn.
It's only heartaches that I meet.
And tears that tell me you have gone from me.
Is it hard to see that,
My heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.
You said we're through,
What can I do,
When there's no you?
This time the loneliness I found,
Has taken over in my mind.
And it will always be around,
For a love like ours I'll never find, I know.
Did you have to go,
'Cause my heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.
You said we're through,
What can I do,
When there's no you?
My heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.

And all of the madness has got you going crazy.
It's time to get out, step out into the street,
Where all of the action is right there at your feet,
well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away,
You'll be doing fine when the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night,
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning,
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget
So, come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home,
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known.
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long.

If you don't know how I feel for you
It's time I let all feelings show
I love you and I'll never
Let you go, no, baby

Right now we're just friends
But baby I pray some you'll surrender to love so tender
I won't push you
As long as you know that my love is true

How about you?

For what we have
But I have feelings inside, they're so strong, I can't hide

I know you're probably thinkin'
That you heard this so many times before
But, girl, when you're here
I want you to stay
And when you're gone
I want you even more every day

Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table, you know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside, they're so strong, I can't hide

Closer than just friends (They're so strong, I can't hide)

Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but

I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees and

I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, Yeah!

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you

I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, ‰ÛÏLove wins again‰Û

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

This time I swear I'm through but if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get, how did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
Nobody, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Seeking fortune and fame

Mesmerized by the tides that hold us together
Wishful thinking me and you one-on-one, lovers, friends forever
Give me the chance to romance and I remind you
They've got a serious future behind you
So come on over here, girl, and do what you please
And don't sweatin' me for checkin' out your groceries
Why do I sweat when I got the juice?
I'm just a girl with a plan, nothin' on the loose
You see, you're the kind of guy that needs my affection
My love and protection, but to be affection
Don't be fronting on me, you know who I am
And other sisters you do just don't give a damn
So brother, I don't want to change your world
All I want to do is be your girl
Understand what I'm sayin'?
I want to be your girl, ooh
Don't want to change the world, I want to be your girl

All round the day was going down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing
Now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you
You once used to know
You reach out your hand
But you're all alone, in these

I know you're in there, you're just out of sight

And lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark

Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Escapade, we'll have a good time
Escapade, leave your worries behind
Escapade, well you could be mine
Escapade, an escapade

My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade

Come on baby, let's get away

 Glen Campbell
 
 Don't pull your love out on me baby
 If you do, I think that maybe I'll just lay
 Me down and cry for a hundred years
 Don't pull your love out on me, honey
 Take my heart, my soul, my money
 But don't leave me here to drown in my own tears
 
 You say you're gonna leave
 Gonna take that big white bird
 Gonna fly right out of here without a single word
 But you know you'll break my heart
 When I watch you close that door
 'Cause I know I won't see you any more
 (repeat chorus)
 
 Haven't I been good to you
 What about that brand new ring
 Doesn't that mean love to you
 Doesn't that mean anything
 If I throw away my pride and I got down on my knees
 Would you make me beg you pretty please
 (Repeat chorus)
 
 There's so much I want to do
 I've got love enough for two
 I'll never use it girl If I don't have you
 (repeat chorus)
 
 THEN YOU CAN TELL ME GOODBYE
 Glen Campbell
 
 Kiss me each morning for a million years
 Hold me each evening by your side
 Tell me you love me for a million years
 Then if it don't work out
 Then if it don't work out
 Then you can tell me goodbye
 
 Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
 Soften my dreams with your sigh
 After you've loved me for a million years
 Then if it don't work out
 Then if it don't work out
 Then you can tell me goodbye
 
 If you must go I won't grieve
 If you just wait a life time before you leave
 If you must go, I won't say ""no""
 Just so we can say that we tried
 Tell me you love me for a million years
 Then if it don't work out
 Then if it don't work out
 Then you can tell me goodbye",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.016960859,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/pV0Dwlq9XKG9NEilHCxHs8l6VUTStENKE0evpg4/4DswW5GkrnK1QOZ0yUduNPKpVwRxviykHB4wrfON4oBMuuhlnsx4jhPfggS7L6G0MJNfT8LS/xCBQIRpPwKqjETvl1+6WKdS1jjN2lYuSzKpYpurx2Y0kjIZMcFBmezb0rc+kbLOJC34rE8AoqZE0nUwJCXh+OpckQe6DZ6M3cI1PcTNg+8ZSMTI7zpmhucEio/YJ5PV5u+aFvIdeU2sK8Qhqq6OXq+x083hEkO66Ju5EANrwjN18dPDffflovG4HwnZswB93NIifOAPC1EFOrNuQLKtgn6oC2mNjnu7ioAb6aRcd6eYjPrcFrgE9LW1xulVtwh+GoR8uXCsV0S4BkAGztEtm78U3tUC1xehyecoDQ66XsZ83k46GhRd9nkuHoUEhQ1kh5LNrAN6atcCx/0IfYzhKm2imQZWfWYoUjCEDw==/,5239996.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/bWMcTL+ZdOlJGXrGd8CngrvfKB+1fhB3PEYPVPiH0InBpvVao4+zjt3Ixn19xIVGp2pouCX09UUKa3rma5IITy2uCcMqiBsaolEzye816hwMC34KS43KUfn1IeG6fmEDfJf3QGztRbb5bSE8HmUskNKOSFp8da1xMzZEKnWwiLhq3Hy1slm4TCwOWm/QMPziSSnSzbGKxNrd8npELgduF5Kb34xNfiI7rUkECqN/hl333ep/IdCInk/+LBlR2zXPwOvv2coKFgvecEGrdlMU7fLyA0AIV4tikBCeeOCUdSBmtLg2Cbr8pdSyA5BFkLE5lbXhSwxuhgno2pOI9a4Wo8/xXv7QZ30YsSlNiyZAs3jDpiw+9R27rBwAJgz6IB2Wi3Ijb7m0Jetmz1CeaNhIb2PpxUQNVXFaLWU9c0AMye3CNEEnDaIbJU19K/Ni5MPS5kspxnG7oKRfK0+3IThNhA==/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:59:16 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/uR9Wpnj+0OrprFUEz1Pd1FWSRFX7pl7mK6fasfyMsVZj5Jw3uzC+cO+U6OtDUuJL3vWkXRGXkYtDyMnmfxrLvB8Elyu86iUNV+dCMA1PNbmrsMePJGKHQu7lQ5wJ6T33J2ukmIus+kwYCpoTMsNCV19xGVLeVPKmFmv4rs5psbx1J4o/EQdHBRy0uRsMqVGVF9va2e8fsRr8gf1J9aU5Srx95tN4wyvjmstMIZtu7AP38/6iCQOkQq+3NohhK0D0FYtSkwtO1N04DJOwxNxUivwvv7aJgEyJ292TQzaK/nsnc0tSKqLU7VDkySduHPUAEsxlO2VOklgkAYP3aMl77l9zotmajybTxS2Cv2A5u1sgcVznNRGBAi3/DuuXaYGyMa7i09RNELb+t4ifOjNvvUkMqELWNkaTZH4bPhrUmOCvzyLRkQtUhnsW5dc1neWkdJ/GXNkOmxorPLgXbr8/Pw==/,200.0,2010-09-14T05:37:06Z,[],don't pull your love/then you can tell me goodbye,1976

Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

And the eyes in his head
See the world. . . . . .

His head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make

And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life

Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin'
And no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let your dream
Just a' watch 'em shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dream he'll never take away

In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day
Your ship 'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' 9 to 5

And you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

Taught it all to Ruby
Then just let her be

Tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby
She broke down to a fool

For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs

He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And baby baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery

If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

I may be drowning with desire from your sweet, sweet touch

Not really, when it comes to lovin' you
You've got my overtime, you bring me peace of mind
And there's so much more I'd like to do

I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caress from your warm embrace
In this ocean of love, no one can take your place

Ride a painted pony, let the spinning wheel spin

You got no money and you, you got no home
Spinning wheel, all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you, you never learn
Ride a painted pony, let the spinning wheel turn

Did you find a directing sign on the straight and narrow highway?
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real

Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning wheel spinning through
Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Catch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride
Ha!

I've done everything I can to ease the pain

Whoop ass, let security carry 'em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are reckless
Feels like a midget is hangin' from my necklace

Lookin', smellin', feelin' like a million bucks
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smokin' that Cheech and Chong

I'm saying oh, baby. Baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Please don't just say, don't just say that you're leaving. (Ba, ba, ba, ba.)
I can't stand it when you cry, baby.
No, no, no.
Tell me that you love me, girl.
See, I don't know, I don't know why my mind keeps saying, keeps telling me.

I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
(Oh baby, don't let me go)
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
(Oh baby, don't let me go)
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby

Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby

When it's gonna come or where it's been.

A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
Don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oeh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it all away
When you think you're in love

I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive

Don't worry about me and who I fire

And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire

In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring

And I will retire with the crown, yes

Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of

What I tell 'em ho's bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to ya knees

Doin' target practice, all these bitches just aimin' to please

Shout out to the CEO, five hundred degrees
Shout out to the OVO, Red Wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year, we ain't get the memo

A young king, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet

Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki-Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh

Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, ""Party of Five""
Are we drinkin' a lil' more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear

Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryin' to make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life

Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

And if I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made
Till then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good

See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

(Verse 1)
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

(Chorus)
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me
that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down
and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me
that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try,
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

Thought that she was the one for me,
Til I found out she was on her creep,
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
This is why we could never be.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

I know it's so unfair to you,
That I relate her ignorance to you,
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...

You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

I thought I'd leave you with a letter or fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank

CHORUS:
If I could find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks, and everything's blank

CHORUS

It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
Come on and read 'em and weep

(Read 'em and weep) - for all the hours we'll be spending alone
(Read 'em and weep) - for the dreams we'll ignore

(Running silent and deep)
And all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore
(Read 'em and weep) - for the magic that our bodies had made
(Read 'em and weep) - for the blood that we lost

(Running silent and deep)
And all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost
(Read 'em and weep) - for the memories still alive in the bed
(Read 'em and weep) - for the lies we believed

(Running silent and deep)
And all the things that can never be said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep

It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known

Who would have thought that we would become lovers
As friends we were so, so tight
Can‰Ûªt help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin‰Ûª

Here today, gone tomorrow
It‰Ûªs possible, but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

He‰Ûªs different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes, head back to the side
Please don‰Ûªt be so mean

14 karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever

No more, no more
Bounce baby, bounce baby
You can move, uh
Check it out

Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on

Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I thought that your love was strong
'Til I saw you in another man's arms

No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more

No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more

I saw you on the Ave' and I laughed
In the backseat beeeze spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm having doubts
Cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you
When I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hanging baguettes around your neck, babe

Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I thought that your love was strong

The blues they sent to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red

The thoughts of all the time I cried
And felt this pain
That I have known
Because I needed just to hear
That special something

And then one day
You just appear
You said ""hello""
""Let's make love along the way""
Your name is music to my heart
I'll always really love you

Feel so good when I'm with you
I can't believe you love me too
With you it feels like it should feel
With you it feels so good

Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

Rain on my head, call that brainstorming

Make you lose yourself and finders keepers

'Cause I let her ride while I drive her crazy

He knocked your crown and ran away
First wound of pride, and how you cried and cried

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you

I saw you standing
and i started, started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too

And just like a roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only 'cause so was I

And I've dreamed of you ever since
Now I've built up my confidence
The next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name

I started to write you letters
But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey baby

But just like a baby
I could not talk
And I tried to come closer
But could not walk

And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right
Oh if we ever come close again
I know what I'll say then yeah

Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word, let me tell you ""I love you""
Let me hold you close, and say these words as gently as I can
""There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved,
But that doesn't mean I love you less,
And he knows he can't possess me, and he knows he never will,
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill""

Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules

You mustn't think you failed me just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had,
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules

Couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

All full of romance for someone that you met

And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on, holding on to time
So far now we're go on living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living

Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall

Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.

And puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.

Never had someone to miss

I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,

Never had room service all night
Never took a trip first class flight
Never had a love affair so tight
I've never felt a feeling so right
Never seen a winter so white
Never had words to recite
Never had a flame to ignite
And I never sang a song with all my might.

But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big...
I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig...
Then the first snow came,
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die...
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And i laughed 'til i cried...
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb, and kinda smart
And i loved her so...
And i surprised her with a puppy,
Kept me up all Christmas eve,
2 years ago...
And it would sure embarrass her when i came in from workin' late,
Cause i would know...
That she'd been sittin there an' cryin',
Over some sad and silly late, late show...

And Honey, i miss you...
And i'm bein' good...
And i'd love to be with you...
If only i could...

She wrecked the car, and she was sad
And so afraid that i'd be mad,
But, what the heck?...
Though i pretended hard to be,
Guess you could say she saw through me,
And hugged my neck...
I came home unexpectedly,
And caught her cryin' needlessly, in the middle of the day...
And it was in the early spring, when flowers bloom, and robins sing,
She went away...

And Honey, i miss you...
And i'm bein' good...
And i'd love to be with you...
If only i could...

One day while i was not at home,
While she was there, and all alone,
The angels came...
Now all i have is memories of Honey
And i wake up nights,
And call her name...
Now my life's an empty stage, where Honey lived, and Honey played
And love grew up...
and a small cloud passes over head,
And cries down on the flower bed that,
Honey loved...

And see the tree? How big it's grown,
But, friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big...

Like I've never, ever known

Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around

And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel

You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)

The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see

Oh tell me why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say...

Chorus

In a passionate set we're moving close
Every bit of love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name

Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

Mike's monolauge:
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot love
Sweet caresses and yes' to me as you rub
And clench my back
Ecstacy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty

Everything in this world that a man could want.
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty Faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me.
Fame and Fortune still can't find, just a grown man runnin' out of time

Though it seems I have everything
I dont wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you.
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see.
That without you girl my life is incomplete.
Listen.
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie.
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday.
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love, I wasn't sure that I was.
it's been a year-Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall.
But being without you just aint livin' aint livin'at all
If I could travel back in time, I'd relive the days you were mine.

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool.
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you.
I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete.
I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late.
I'd give anything and everything to hear you say, that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything.
I don't wanna be a lonely fool.
All of the women, all of the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you.

And you remind me of my past cuz they are very uplifting
And plan to give a little but a lot is what you want
And like my hat is to da back we can both sit down in front
I understand what a man is all about
You understand I can't have anybody else without a doubt
We understand that you as you I wouldn't want to be without
Understandin' is the key which holds a very large amount
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Heck just expect to be checked
Return the favor and the rest just flows
I'll be standin' on my toes as the rest turn into ho's

A breath away's not far to where you are.

Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dream?
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen

As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me
Everyday

Cause you are mine
Forever love
Watching me
From up above

And I believe
That angels breathe
and that love will live on
And never leave

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for a while
To know you're there
A breath away's not far to where you are.

I know you're there
A breath away's not far to where you are",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.011166096,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Yi4s1aRvssWfvyxxsZVSveUnE2GufDAVC18EXUtrjAxAvsLLFFjC0rpxgSROl3RMmv2BKygvA5r9O2IU5y5NcNiZgVKPe8CiFcJJKUq/gQbTbfQ9yNXRZKPa/7A5QwVyN/Kq1F4PjuQqv0NnidPUbv5HA0syu0NETC11QoFncbfGyKIMSPEQF5WcyDElZbRZp2DlygCZrhWexLkARNe4KH8eDc3Q+rAFYD+gUIR6yq6jrlj/O4gVqAfrryi9qjEPBZSUX+nkFphSZaziwlSeiXHpMZc+Obq9ivHEQUfpzNfpPhnmAFUPgqM3ggC6XeLNfoaHHkgEyGkBViEgtZ2y3cxaiWsWEA4M7AlrwWZIOnONNuIm8jDJISS6KbPGFl+Ld5Z7ddNJc5mwjjZaiWBjMKmyWV28fjKKhBik37nNY+g=/,6379891.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Yi4s1aRvssWfvyxxsZVSveUnE2GufDAVC18EXUtrjAxAvsLLFFjC0rpxgSROl3RMmv2BKygvA5r9O2IU5y5NcNiZgVKPe8CiFcJJKUq/gQbTbfQ9yNXRZKPa/7A5QwVyN/Kq1F4PjuQqv0NnidPUbv5HA0syu0NETC11QoFncbfGyKIMSPEQF5WcyDElZbRZp2DlygCZrhWexLkARNe4KLRcsnXb+884GJePIspNb58QKRP4Q0y+YI+BLhaEBsmSewluoXOWqKhrCCVQtSlOOoIWtg0R9STYawVrczVgISbFVuEY/UukqRhYb2o5FoQmQWHfvzu2FrrcNwkjKaVyDhQC6kSvu3vxtK1ll96PalkOEblnwbRjCGp4N/4xT4r7yPt9AnTca83bPD4QLPgyfsvGYuyLLe7lyOuqWQ4l0RM=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:10:47 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Ez/K+gr752GjzuC3h65vL7xSAfYjYV0AI46eoKGu+75HOjgJJwl9RLSqJ8gyYcBnudWPbecsJAa0TyfnXjhjMMqfROnFcGK5hOZ+cNr14HNWel8Zn56nxBlgkR9j8tQhKjUrozM5+ktn/7zk5urNP0200AD5pM81h6Ib4k5N7oridTINxwL/N6Yc+Sam/7YdZvaRymPGA8pkpth4wlwMNQdsCKxvUtx8XOSg55MIuDfvug3ArjR2xEUjXu30kEaq/5ZBgys6It9ZtmIe/biJVzEhso5FNEBaH1xpEskHXW904tEVzz5K9Ve/nrCRwSbsj9Qu7Zuo/vrfkRlXbOu6VeeDwKGhdQaQXEuWCskeThtqlNEey9HVXxKRsqleubHxk2DVebhtiJ27xGmpoP9+ppf5yi1jLsuAEAaYakvtKJ4=/,200.0,2011-06-07T07:55:24Z,[],to where you are,2002

Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the sea
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
In the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

And I have loved you dearly

Too many times I feel
We are losing time once shared
And only when you're in ecstasy
You seem to really care

Didn't you say not to worry
I can only speak for myself
How do you think that I'm happy, baby
With a love like mine
Locked up on a shelf

Remember my love had a place
It was a part of the game
And just when I went all the way
I'm in too deep
Girl, you made the choice
And sent away

[CHORUS]

When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living

I discovered you were untrue
So unfortunate for you
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I only gave you the best
I ever had to you

Don't let sympathy show her face
Girl, let's not pretend
I'm no longer in this race
You've got your space
Still it hurts me that you

I still hear your sea winds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was 21
When I left Galveston

Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath - it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

And in my honest observation
During this operation
(Oh)
Found a complication in your heart
So long, 'cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?

A whole new world
(A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
(Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment gets better)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
(A whole new world)
That's where we'll be
(Where we will be)
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby

Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now

I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
You took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
Mmm, mmm, mmm

The love that came to be
Feel so alive

The answer, that Heaven, has sent down to me

But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high

She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The lock was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
It's not against the law
The point of no return
And now you know the score
And now you're learning
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pantry
Had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At city club were something in diplomacy

So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
And now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
No it's not against the law
The point of no return
Now how you know the score
And now you're learning
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And one of us could reach that high

I can't deny it
With that smile on my face
Oh oh, it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
Knocking at your door

Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Yours appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
I wanna be your midnight rambler

Quickly but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear, come on

Their love young and new
His bold arms, her rendesvous

And tears fill her eyes
His warm lips a memory
As she sighs

The snow's come

And still, they're apart
How empty

This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road

Standing like a stone on the old plantation
The rich old man would have never let him in
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on alone, alone",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.00809288,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/eLHwLIlX+svAgyC89+ee63JiNgNEuEDEuUjyg1jeO3oZmIbfHLUUdHYrp46C2XQYI2E+Ngp1CFzZ1gqqAQL9x4MfbawZjMtqhfyit6ke5KdjYSVPWj8hIEUA2L9xCUnFJefr1krGoFR6EGNm9pekZexLOoyTbqC8bREcBNIbIV2VYYzSx+3JKmh1r2KYX6DuOXrD7rEbei+PIC1Ql39pS90GlDS/A8ImEloQd6U70m21rZem6hvtaEgg8uOkc+/8VhAIoXlvnosXkvXTq9vL9UdrItEG+G9HaJubYlhk6RIkfucTX2PfH8k+05hxa5lR8Z1WNxgnwLsuNK/6YFr7NwhmrpbsP8KU/jsWatrHO2E9eGqKGZFcSM119DAZwjs6K/Dy88PKxOLYJaVogepXJqMMNnRCAkylNyKIxIMGriI=/,1289740.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/6KfCFty7vXFVbY6/On5NgP9Pwh6TWs4PU0mem+WCOEyZWkbd6LSqRh6zACTgaYjleLLi7xPkEni7myo4NhpMeQt/+bLg2lwirGivGu6Tu0HUxeC/MFHmkP7jf3ie11ktRPzbeBI5mF27Tyel/rcweG3uyGZCDQxjrWtd1oit71N5+q6ID30KfvaxG/Nilt6PVyZErtmN+/CJJBzvQyvJVQ2+4tUkS80dnHvq91wpgRj2TwIQqY/ED39Q1uzbNTCemYZJ1JqL6GSNfbh2/ZO1eUEK7cxQqLBy68ZVJiZLGrGyGBzxMkFzFL027gEHmNnTvLbsMCh/urit2tI39DuM+e+BpgbmxaL0uqCBRsJnovUGruGZJeBmq+H5U9OB218qBEKwosMxA112LRpMMsw/H/4c5RqpRwB30/ohaOztaz0=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:04:09 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/v16yvxlTGOyVBbhv0R3mHdwseFdZzOO2YZwJxBxj4zsJCN6kd71gFskUxl1RI3rVM2fYqkmZYHp2pPSTE6qKb98luRMGtNiKUNoRVpTcSoPvChjFuYKUa+YSWJN0J757+QoQGH1IfFCQkQ5R0BntdRPFN2GkQxlCfhnsPkTjOEdyh6VkolCesYKhIKsvtsa3Fw43uyDlN+n0Vbk94OObCVLgUdLxtwS1OU7aYyk+IwOA/eLMcXFxvozlvc8usrvczWGtmeTJiCqK+nybb1Az3DQv2aJdtZJVsZrikeLkUOiZ6A5QrcYTvBEnGpwAVnzCoSgEacxvco0XrclM+fmNLz8KVQBmXkrmW0951a2tIo6gbXrkJHL3vD5L0ZS9kt2AECIaa8JITB5v3QMnBPkvlkoRjZJFY9/RD0vgqAterQ8=/,200.0,2010-07-02T12:11:09Z,[],the valley road,1988

Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try
And if all those plans I made don't melt the lady's heart,
I'll put on the old 45's

And maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

It's been too long since I've seen her face light up when I come home
It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you to bring her back to me
I'm tired of listening alone

When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry

They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Oh, mmm, you're my desire, you take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know

Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

She was sent here from heaven and she's daddy's little girl.
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
and I thank god for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all

For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer;
sticking little white flowers all up in her hair;
""Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride.""
""I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried.""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning And butterfly kisses at night.

Sweet 16 today
She's looking like her mama a little more everyday
One part woman, the other part girl.
To perfume and make-up from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world.
But I remember...

Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer;
sticking little white flowers all up in her hair.
""You know how much I love you, Daddy,
But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time.""
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right
to deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night.

All the precious time
Like the wind, the years go by.
Precious butterfly.
Spread your wings and fly.

She'll change her name today.
She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.
Standing in the bride-room just staring at her.
She asked me what I'm thinking and I said
""I'm not sure-I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl.""
She leaned over

Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there,
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle, Daddy-it's just about time.""
""Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right.
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses

If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love
Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow they can't rise above
Rainy day lovers don't love any others, that would not be kind
Rainy day people all know how it hangs on a piece of mind

Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you, they've been down there too
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two.

Take it or leave it, or try to believe it

Calling all cars (REPEAT)

I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around and
Brought about a change in me

I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were runnin' fast
I was runnin' slow
Everybody said that it would not work
Love came and set me free
You were standing there to rescue me
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

Why, it's no crime
If I'm guilty of love
Let me do my time
Why, it's no crime
Everybody needs love
And baby (so do I)

You never thought love
Came so easily
No doubt about it
Never in your dreams, no way

You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good our love could be
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

HOOK

I've spent half a lifetime
Waiting for someone
You say I know it was you
They don't recommend it
I don't understand it
I've been reprimanded
'Cause I'm in love with you

Calling all cars (REPEAT)

You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good our love could be
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

Why, why

So do I, so do I
So do I, so do I
Oh so do I

I see the kids in the street,
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul

Pretending that they're not alone?

Somebody's broken heart

Haven't we had enough?

For all of the times you told me you need me
Needing me now is something I could use

Maybe it's not the end

I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Start to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
In the dark, can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
You're the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
When I see you (See you)
When I see you

I never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you
When I see you

I scribble x and o's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and my nails look
I feel myself in a zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say i'm not home
I see your face
And I hear my favorite song
Should I send an e-mail at home?
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue, yeah

I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why, yeah yeah yeah

You're always on my mind (You're always)
When you come around I get shy
When I see you (So sexy boy)
When I see you (You're sexy boy)

I never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you
When I see you

Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not gonna run not
Just gonna stand here and see
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

You're always on my mind (Hey baby)
When you come around I get shy
When I see you
When I see you

I never know when you might walk by (I don't know)
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you (But I get nervous around you)
When I see you

You're always on my mind (You're always)
When you come around I get shy
When I see you (You, you, you)
When I see you (I love it, I love it)

Come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn‰Ûªt.
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
Get up! Thrift shop pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweater gang nope nope y‰Ûªall can‰Ûªt copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I‰Ûªm on.
Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing

Labels out here,
Nah they can‰Ûªt tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Nah they can‰Ûªt tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we‰Ûªll fight till it‰Ûªs over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we‰Ûªll fight till it‰Ûªs over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us

Nah, can I kick it? thank you. yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that‰Ûªs what you get when Wu tang raised you
Y‰Ûªall can‰Ûªt stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I‰Ûªm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
Caesar make you a believer. nah I never ever did it for a throne.
That validation comes from giving it back to the people. nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we‰Ûªll fight till it‰Ûªs over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we‰Ûªll fight till it‰Ûªs over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Ma-ckle-more

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we‰Ûªll fight till it‰Ûªs over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Like the ceiling can‰Ûªt hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment

At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time

Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Sometimes goodbyes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home
and somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me
Letting go is just another way to say
I'll always love you so

We had the right love
At the wrong time
Maybe we've only just begun
Maybe the best is yet to come

From a distance the ocean meets the stream,

From a distance, there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
it's the voice of every man.

From a distance we all have enough,
and no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
no hungry mouths to feed.

From a distance we are instruments
marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.
God is watching us. God is watching us.
God is watching us from a distance.

From a distance you look like my friend,
even though we are at war.
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
what all this fighting is for.

From a distance there is harmony,

Fall upon my window pane
I find I'm crying over and over

But now he's here, it's not the same, it's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go, he won't let go

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up, he gives me love
More, more love, more love, more love, more love

Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody... how I do

You close your eyes as I im-prov between your legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables,

From your high, would we've been all right?

But you'll never find

If you let them
Steal your heart from you

We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and ties
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces
And mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you
Like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other

You are far

She smiles at him as he walks through the door
She wonders if it will be okay
It's hard for her when he doesn't respond

He says babe you look a mess
You look dowdy in that dress
It's just not like it used to be
Then she says...

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

She stands there and lets the tears flow
Tears that she's been holding back so long
She wonders where did all the loving go
The love they used to share when they were strong

She says yes I look a mess
But I don't love you any less
I thought you always thought enough of me to always be impressed

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

He holds her and hangs his head in shame
He doesn't see her like he used to do
He's too wrapped up in working for his pay
He hasn't seen the pain he's put her through

Attention that he paid
Just vanished in the haze
He remembers how it used to be
When he used to say

You'll always be a lady
'Cos you're all woman
From monday to sunday I love you much more than you know
You're a classy lady
'Cos you're all woman
This woman needs a loving man to keep her warm

You're the only one
You're a classy lady
'Cos you're all woman

Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life

I stumble out of bed
Stretching and a'yawning
Another day ahead
It seems to last forever
And time will slowly ride
'Til babe and me's together
Then is starts on fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me
Time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me
Everything's all right
Night-time is the right time

We make love
Then it's his and my time
We take up

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine 'til five and then
He takes another home again
To find the waiting for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine 'til five and then
He takes another home again
To find the waiting for him

He takes me to a movie
Or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing
Anything I want
Only when he's with me
I catch alight
Only when he gives me
Makes me feel all right

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine 'til five and then
He takes another home again
To find the waiting for him

All day I think of him
Dreaming of him constantly
I'm crazy, mad for him
And he's crazy, mad for me

When he steps off the train
I meet him before the fight
Work all day to earn his pay
So we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine 'til five and then
He takes another home again
To find the waiting for him

He's always on the morning train
He works so hard
To find the wating for him

Hurting each other

On a weeping willow, baby, we are

There's no way we could disguise it

So we take each other's hand

The urgency just remember

Just remember

So far from hangin on the block for dough

Life aint always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words cant express what you mean to me
Even though youre gone, we still a team
Through your family, Ill fulfill your dream (thats right)
In the future, cant wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When its real, feelings hard to conceal
Cant imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death

Every single day, every time I pray

Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break

Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin hits, stages they receive you on
I still cant believe youre gone (cant believe youre gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living youre life, after death

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
Ill be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
Ill be missing you

[faith evans] somebody tell me why

(Interlude: faith evans)

On that morning
When this life is over
I know
Ill see your face

(Outro: 112)

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
[puff] every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
[puff] is a day that I get closer
[puff] to seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
[puff] we miss you big... and we wont stop
Every move I make, every single day
[puff] cause we cant stop... thats right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
[puff] we miss you big

Coudja maybe give me somethin'?
'cause the feeling is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees that

That I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feelin again
All around, tryin' to get the feelin again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in

And I've looked high, low
Everywhere I possibly can
But there's no, tryin' to get the feelin' again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came

Where did it run to? I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the love light burnin'
But whatever I've done, I guess I just haven't done it too good
'cause all that's left is

I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again

We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow,
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
Touch me in the morning...",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.00838995,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/cPerx+Q9q2zBocReimRgrdMzN4twh3PRo5qpsnrDiGqGoDFYw4E2jVXF1pUB2L8nvs+oV6OsQ7ipY0rKfJm+LwfbaJ2Cc6u4X1NskG+kpfeL5gXLCE/prkUGFUCOwKe2woYJncbtWqkKtZ9knBmFeWT/5hWNtoRL9hMLfby8g+gUp7fMyU2kic/KRJufb8JhBSz8SEpo+nKji8nXlxI1+E8LDnz52oLHuVIzkxZrKTtBPRdHfv0BkeXqQUXJyq2TBFXibIcxmKf7Lyft0othNlBQx/JyinlnlfuZ2QoTdV5NbkNpUTZW0Swnawpz//kGuiY5PzBeCVY0mbmXSGQdO7VPXzTxc69SgI0i8sqK4ppA2F4Er/G63GljsF5a1SqsuVqhi/ewQuHCY2n9L1RnfVuMPp3uOUHavVGDbkI30CU=/,1371300.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/jEqRoIj9pOyRspxhOTIFQd8xiKj+ToxRaossaDHL318QwRtA8zD8XV5XTIXE7c6pZnOwCbmhHOz7Eg/cnvwrQSncKake4B2IBdpI8fN/cjrfJdFSYrAd9ZfBYePua67Mk7YBF5nEnosdPh6rMeBQJN16R0isxlEVLnJMHJposMXzdrbp6WBX6PN891cE13g8ZcDa4fShN+0kKxmhYoHD4LBmPInF/JdASWHwLgLMdrL87wg9juoyBFo3FYPrlFQ0xuaVcC0xuwvXDReeCB18SCDraiYKQK1fKKKJBAFn4GG+CgGUAZzC+JJUE4UIFHVK3iRWPf/v7uQY3o7HsH5xh507YHSPJai5EbqGgFTsIJzqSF+5bk4WkO4iBmfgWWV05xHTidB1+zoOj9fz9/G829RWHxPaJcbEK77qe90AS4k=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:58:08 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/gpkRepfFlrI3wV8u56q6vmJIUYZZaohc3eyCBxihYBWTAFCLvGLDlx9ffba6erInJkni3VJDiwBOjGcQ8j869XqEQCAzw/+f7v/reLpcgXlEpAfs0ard3NjFGpdKp69gXw03LvEpdoM8IBBth2JY/tHo/j2BMD4861pnVgwHiFrp8I5NJxZ5tu78zdI+Dy4Kpn8631Pg5XNiDanjpP7BjK/UG2sq/QI+Nn3UXgwePdthr/ryXh6ew54ImSoobqe03eyW9Ogvz8aeVX6nqxk6MUylhBAQfbwgg88qwbhMjzHgWJ4Flg3kSDbrTfbH80LlycbePGOSJxxzoKH10YtzDAYNWZJz6UMjaegyO817Gx7EjrQDZ5LZcQv/4Glx/ky+SgnrlJ+F3x+AwG+NWeOIMQ+Da1ZA6svOK86z7Ts0cxU=/,200.0,2010-06-29T04:31:46Z,[],touch me in the morning,1973

As all the walls come tumbling down

You were that special one

You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good
Why it takes so long for me finding you

This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back
I really don't know just where I'd be at

Glad you came into my life (Ooh...)
You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

Never thought about settling down
But all the time I knew I was ready
But not with all my friends around

But girl, I put you first now (I put you first now)
You made me, helped mold me (Helped mold me, baby)
Turned me into a man, I'm so responsible

There! I've Said It Again
There! I've said it again
Bobby Vinton
I love you, there's nothing to hide,
It's better than burning inside,
I love you, no use to pretend,
There! I've said it again.
I've said it, what more can I say,
Believe me, there's no other way,
I love you, I will to the end,
There! I've said it again.
I try to drum up,
A phrase that will sum up,
All that I feel for you.
But what good are phrases,
The thought that amazes,
Is that you love me,
And it's heavenly.
Forgive me for wanting you so,
But one thing I want you to know,
I've loved you since heaven knows when,
There! I've said it again.

Flying my bike past the gates
Of the factories
My mom doing the laundry
Hanging our shirts
In the dirty breeze

It's just imagin-ation they lack
Everything's the same

G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind and why you keep dissin' me,
Poor little me.
And why you have a change of heart to turn it all around
And then try to put it on me,
Poor little me.
But don't you know I can be a trip.
I can make things hard.
But baby, I believe that you still got a heart.
That's why I try to stop myself before I start,
'Cause I can make it tough.
I can make it rough, but I won't.
Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt.
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Oooh, oooooooooh.
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me,
Poor little me,
When you knew all the time that you could've been with your homegirl lovin' and a kissin' on me,
Sweet little me.
But don't you know if you wanna be a man,
You gotta work real hard.
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one,
Then nothing in the world should make us part.
'Cause we can make it work, if you take away the hurt from my heart.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out.
(Work, work, work.) Work it, baby.
(Work, work, work.) Keep trying to work it on, work it on, work it on, work it on out.
(Work, work, work.) Work it, baby.
(Work, work, work.) Keep trying to work it on out. Mmmm.
(Oh) I can be a trip, but I choose not to.
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you, I think there's still good in you, boy.
(Oh) Don't give me no reason not to trust you.
(Oh, oh) Just take the benefit.
Don't give me no lip and I'll be sweet to you.

Not much, how about you?
I'm not sure why I called
I guess I really just wanted to talk to you

And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for a while
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
And I'd really love to see you tonight

We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see it really doesn't matter much to me

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I won't ask for promises
So you don't have to lie
We've both played that game before
Say I love you and say goodbye

I'm not talking about moving in

Gonna sing it to you time and time again.

Every man deserves a good woman
and I want you to be my wife.
Time is so much better spent with you
baby

a woman just like you in my life.
So let me love you
fill you up inside

I want to hold you

So let me squeeze you

don't you know that I'll get down on my knees for you

You see: I ain't much on Casanova

And I iust got to let you know how much I need you

Show you what you mean to me each day
baby.


So let me hold you
keeping you safe and warm

I'll be your sweatheart
baby.

And when I told you: Girl
I'm an average guy

You seem to know just how I really feel.
'Cause I can't let you go

I need and want you to stay right here with me.
Baby
I never knew love until you came along.

Oh

tell me what to say
Casanova

I can't let you get away.
Oh
Casanova
tell me what to do

I just wanna be with you.

You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me

I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

When there's someone home who's

And I wonder what to do so she won't see that

When I know it wasn't right
And I found a better life than what we had

And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you

When I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone

I still remember
And the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on

To the end of our rainbow

Yes, you're once twice

With every beat of my heart

To feel you to need you

And you always order the special with the hot chocolate
And my manager be trippin' and stuff

But I always use some milk and cream for you

Anyway you always got on some fly blue suit
An' your cufflinks are shinin' all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interestin'

But I was wonderin' if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day

Ya know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean we could just go across the street to the park right here

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up

Go, shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday!

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight)
In the hood, in L.A, they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex I, ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't change

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my jaws get to bumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at you, bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, nigga,
In the club all the time, nigga, it's about to pop off, nigga

(Listen)
Pay attention
Are you listening
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid
The picture's very clear

Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you
Just a way to tell you
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

Erotic whispers
For the listener
The passion starts again
And the lollipops and everything
With the little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stood still

Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

(All I need is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

Close your eyes
And let the music
Put you in a mood
Can you feel it
Uh huh
(Uh huh)

Baby just lock the door
And turn the phone off
It's time, it's time
For me and you
Are you ready

Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you)
Just a way to tell you
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

(All I need is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
Don't disturb this groove

Everyday we used to slip away to talk
We would talk about the goodness of your heart
Now it seems I admit that never exist at all
And it leaves me feeling empty with this hollow chord

Make it like it was
The way it used to be
When I hungered for your love
Constantly

Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

At a certain time you would find me on my knees
Asking you to show light on my brother's needs
Now it seems the needs are a secondary thing
And it truly makes me wonder what's really happening

Make it like it was
The way it used to be
When I hungered for your love
Constantly

Make it like it was
It was easier for me
I know you're able
To make it like it was

Now when I compare, there's really no comparing
I just want it the way it used to be
Just the thought of living with the horror
Makes me ask that you make it like it was

Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you, yeah

Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows

Baby, with me and you it's whatever girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?

And I, I pray for someone good to come, any love

And I can't wait for my love life to shine, to shine

I've got to be very strong, to keep holdin' on

Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
You almost kinda watching this
Aha
Whooo!
Escape

Ooh your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst
Of you and I can not resist at all

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feelin' blue
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Gimme your love (8x)

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know are stated
To relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all

The things you want me to

Or leave me feelin' blue

She said that if I called you

What am I to say

To this new girl just had last night
I tried to keep it light
When she held me in her arms, she knew
She told me that I hadn‰Ûªt gotten over you

I wonder if I called you
Would you make me pay for my mistake, ooh?

Is it now too late

Or can we get it back
Everything that we once had, ooh

Boy toy named Troy, used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was getting some coins
Was in shoot outs with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real...
Gun in my purse, bitch I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I'll have 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep telling me to chill
He keep telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he wants something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with a jab like

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country ass nigga, let me play with his rifle

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
(You can have it all back)
Flowers, cards, and candy,
(I do it just cause I'm...)
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you gIrl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best i can

After all that - this is what i found
Everyone of ya'll are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad... hey

Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

Hang up and you call right back

Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees

Just as good even when you close your eyes

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feel so good, feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting

On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you

I just want a token that can't go to waste - Diamonds.

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
They tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

‰Û÷Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day, you're taking one down

You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie

You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Mmm, on a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong

So where was the passion when you need it the most?
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

‰Û÷Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Sometimes I see you and you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire and holding on we find

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more

Believing in the one thing

That's what love is for
To help us through it

Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more

[Verse: Ricky Bell]
I went out, last niiiiiiiight
See, that's when I met a sexy girl
She was lookin' so riiiiiiiiiiight
She said, ""I wanna take you for a trip around the world""
And by the look in her eyes, ho
The girl was serious!
She wore no disguise, oh no.
So let's have some fun, yeah!
[Chorus:]
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys
[Michael Bivins:]
Yo, I love bein a bachelor
Ricky said, ""Yo, that girl's a good catch for ya""
She and I choose to cruise in my love boat
My waterbed, kept us afloat
I had to prove my manhood
Show her that the B-I-V was DAMN good, understood?
I never had my boat rocked like that before, YO!
[Ricky Bell:]
The way we left the spot, all systems ready to go
She said, ""Sit back and relax, I'm runnin' the show""
I couldn't hesitate, it was much too late
That girl had got me straight, and I was ready to go, yeah!
B! (yeah.)
B! (yeah.)
D! (yeah...)

[Michael Bivins:]
Yo' Ron, was-SUP, wit that
fly girl you left the jam with?
She's stickin' closer to you
Than the bread on the meat of my sandwich
I know you rock a beach, cuz
[Ronnie DeVoe:]

Naaaw, it wasn't even like that
She left the room to get comfy and cozy (wha?)
Then the R to the O to the N got nosey
[Ricky Bell:]
Cruising guys was her favorite past-time
Takin' chances almost got her lifetime
She said, ""You only live oooooonce""
Stayin' loose, made many head turns
If you did her wrong, you just might get burned.
So let's have some fun, yeah-HE!
[Chorus:]

Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taking
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009667873,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/bnp7Ghru3FelsHgF1Rxr76OniTTNjkVKCTgRiq5H6sNsOw8EFXWNbDyco3Znypkl1AnAE42vVr1I4AMgQ5jkjjZTZ7eBHwMyLgCpLo2GVuigCJuheI41AC3FQnF6LNTTU+Zvmp9SuTkUSz/BaA4GGNApsGmJbdLNXJIALRazc4sAI8bfqBUQCLJ80WoTiT4FdOe19OTac8wv0lL6bn+8OqeK/uPaK+AZkZ1Jfw0XjnB9I12XHCg+eFk+B8RIShsck7T1ctbZ7y5yzr4QlqLh7T7Ry/b6Y74EyisgD6eKM01H25vSj5phwdN+v+lquzsDVr3XfULgJqEvBThmSjrTmmP5lGG2U/WQ8u99QT+BaFCmS6iFwISqVFHZkyeMYwVZ/,7254370.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/6iGYH7bamBAnNyZnJ07jd8KDhO+BhYF7TjTvuf0TJKOBAc0NeWhsVWePLH7cU4LqdpoZtQrpAOpVr0zFVIjBFcLvpMc8+PWZBLEOdfv5xoH2Fn4rBJgurOthluFKdwlpwRi1IIdPCcvsH5Gs7ASxa8NMEtM5C7FTIuuztsYAl58iKGM5kFKgPEdhJHlWsrwyZO8msvfYjzG5RInpIiEC1nQNjJ7O+kTbGR63MCV43BYE0ipOdWh6PmFPxsT49HjJkP/lfHgQt/PnyNAccyVOfovq2OXOZUwpRzoeDzuRJ9AcBUO0vV0n2gLeSUPUDMKvsiZOszGhSRIHsf3XRqZ+9SAy8T8txdFzz7YzHFZJTnaj2OM3YWWAhAQyIZmH0dZt/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:00:51 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/gQdXqtRiKPOJqzNU3Yq9LFXWpORGuEeezZt7xz2R2eErwX+j9jQSE957sGqONVcZh5sA8ihYpSQCgKruC35ArvBcG5SxKXUFo7dNUucnUhrwPp6aBIE2YsR5ZXvI2NLIJrYUavbJA2fF1Wn+amSDab/+9E/h3nquWMwNL6vi8mIhEfUAs3dMN8A3Nx/3e28UHfistjVBa4XfxneGyN9cCzmcqmV0r4RNVdk2CiUFgj00ikvdTmlkjymqBnSFsCTneeirrQFyA9RSiPSJYsO7S1kfz/ra2NWWQTXLdETEuOpGy/FQX/ciXmUESNmHRPqaRgIg7ABdYJxEa7p//cFGlRdA+TN93NCQKfdeHENxnR9Ztzk8ARaN3Kp4M6kfZVXg/,200.0,2012-04-13T10:38:58Z,[],the rose,1980

Oh baby

I dreamed of you last night
And oh, your face was so very clear
All I could do is think about the good times
That you and I used to share

I could still remember the last time
Oh, I held you in my arms
But all those days have come and gone now
And all I seem to do is cry

It hurts
(It hurts)
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love
(Our love)
Could last throughout eternity
Now it's history, baby

It should've been you
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
Was meant to be

But if I had you, oh babe
This time you'd see
You would have all my love
I kept inside of me
(I kept inside)

Well, have you got somebody else
Yes, I've got somebody too
But you know I've finally realized
No one could ever take the place of you, no

I'm not the one to place the blame
Or for whatever the fault just might be
All I need is to find a little happiness
Oh, in life that will fulfill me

It's you
(It's you)
It's you that means more to me
Without your love
It's nothin' more than fantasy
Baby, come back to me

It should've been you, oh girl
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life

It should've been you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
But my eyes were closed and I didn't see

Oh, it should've been you, baby
It should've been me
It would've been all those things in life
That was meant to be, was meant to be, meant to be, babe

Oh, if I had you, girl
This time you'll see
This time you would have all the love
All the love, all the love that I kept inside of me

You know so much time has passed
Since you and I've being together
So much time till I
I don't know quite how to start

All I know is that from that day until this
You remain on my mind and in my heart
You know I was never really clear
Just what went wrong

I guess that's why I had to write this song
If I know then what I know now
I would have never let you go
No way, no

Oh, it hurts

Could last throughout eternity

It should've been me

Oh, it should've been me
It would've been all those things in life

Oh, I know if I had you, girl
I know this time you'll see
I'll show you, baby
You could have all my love
All the love, all the love I kept wrapped up inside of me, oh yeah

Why don't you give me one more chance
If you wanna be with me
Take a chance with me, baby

Oh, baby

Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
Ive gone much too far for you now to say
That Ive got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you Ive been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you dont believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what Ive searched to discover
Ive come much too far for me now to find
The love that Ive sought can never be mine

And though you dont believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I

Big John

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John

When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you

They said you were leaving
Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see its true

Tell me all about it
Tell about the plans you're making
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
and how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

Didn't come here for crying
didn't come here to break down
It's just the dream of mine is coming to an end

How can I blame you
when I built my world around
the hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends

I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
I need you now
it's more than I can take

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
and how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
Now that you're dream has come true

Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died givin' me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife

You know, Lord, I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
But I've climbed them all, one by one

But this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman tired of the hardships
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of workin' for nothin'
Tired of bein' my wife

She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for livin'
She took my small baby boy

So this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb

Travelling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise

Finds the high but comes down feeling lower
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says

You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show

You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so

Single parent trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone
To make their house a home

Finds someone but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says

You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show

I feel a storm coming.

When autumn first arrived you were my lady.
And love was written in the wind to show
And with the change of months there came October.
And now I wonder where our love did go.
It was the second rain of autumn we shared our feelings.
It was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was.
But like kids we were too shy to say to each other that together, we would always like to be.

Someday soon I know we'll come together.
Even though our feelings change as seasons do.
But, maybe sweet November will tell us the story that will bring us back the love that we both knew.

When autumn first arrived you said you'd be my lady and you promised me that you would never go, ooh hoo.
And with the change of months there came October and now I'm wondering Where?
Where did our love go?
It was the second rain of autumn (second rain of autumn) we shared our feelings.
And it was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was.
But like kids we were too shy to say to one another that together we would always like to be.

Someday soon I know we'll come together.
Even though our feelings change as seasons do.
But maybe sweet November will tell us the story that will bring us back the love that we both knew.

I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
And pretty soon all my troubles will pass

Shu shu shu shu shu shu Sugar Town.

I never had a dog that liked me some
I never had a friend or wanted one
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
'Cause I'm in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,

Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
I heard it also rained in Talahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
'Cause I was in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,

If I had a million dollars or ten
I'd give it to your world and then
You'd go away and let me spend

No more, no more won't get hurt any more

Until I saw you last night

And then I knew that
Here I go again
I cannot help it
Here I go again

Making the same mistakes
Heading for more heartaches
What can I do when there's nothing I can do?
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was blue

What 's the use?
I'll just give in
Try as I may and I do
I'll never win, never win, baby, I'll never win

Now, you're here, so close to me
I can't resist you
And I knew when I kissed you

Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

'Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

Up in the club wit my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key (low key)
You should know how it feels (hey! hey!)
I seen shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she knew me (knew me)
I decided to cheat (okay!) Conversation got heavy! (hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! (watch out!)
Oh! (watch out!) She's saying ""come get me!"" (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said ""baby let's go""
When I told her (let's go!) I said

(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah
Shorty got down on me, said come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leeeeaaavvee) (let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10, she's a certified 20
But that's just ain't me (hey!)
Cause I don't - know, if I take that chance
She swears he's gonna leave
But what I do - know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright wit me
The way's she's Getting Low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave? (let's go!)
And I say.

Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth!
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off wit their clothes
Then ""bend over to the front! and touch your toes!""
I - left the Jag I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll (oww!)
How ya like me now?
When my pinky's baguette over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ush' once more, and we leaves em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say.

With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you been hanging
Around my mind, K-CI sing it

Far more frequently your wearing perfume
With you say the special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know never know

Oh I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses but what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide 'cuz they always start to cry
'Cuz this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
And it's very slowly picking me apart
I've tried to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Now just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thought's your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses but what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide 'cuz they always start to cry
'Cuz this time could mean goodbye

Oh I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses but what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide 'cuz they always start to cry

Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care, you're always there

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be
Without a friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
When you're near, my love

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I've found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
Oh my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
I expect to leave on time

He's all mine
And his loving makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(Baby all night long)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
He's quite a bit of heaven
When he comes inside
So come on sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we're going next
I expect to leave on time

I get weak
And his candy's just so sweet
When he caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you (Yes I do)
Cause you affect me
Fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now (Whoo)

My thoughts flow in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Candy)
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy
It's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed I do)

Loverboy
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman was a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know how he come to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town right up to the traffic cop

From the movie ""What Did You Do In the War, Daddy?"" starring James Coburn

(peak Billboard position # 49 in 1966)

If I could hold you in the arms of love tonight
I'd never let you go
As the hours go by I'd show you why we've waited for this
As two lovers whisper low

If I could feel that magic kiss your lips invite
Imagine the joys I'd know
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight


The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

Said it ain't gon' be easy

Be a man and get it over with (over with)

Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me

[Breakdown]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009984016,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/jUOs/1QO5MZyRnYoS8DdzQyyNj1XEItVWpMksz/of3DuELzXYmTDCBfPropITI+ou9Hya+uPtODgc+3KcaievaxCZvTXofflz5bvrffXEOhzVk+RqFhwCz/uI2InNM+891EPtXo/QEZL+fRszOOooJ748Ea+cIJAdeqHFXDAnHAeppJLT952zwtW1uyhO4DAbEGkThSHu2uPOy0lM4FTwuLsYuULOdeOki2tzM1vLKfxbO+RZaVQo3ekWAKHbukUTehzrlQlJ41VVaS93ncSdO3BijiJ45LSaTFPn2SJUvL9GEK4qjyb7lEg1ixoPVbSK9/d1H+d186rPbbhAKrhxDekFnkzTiuzTE0jp2wtiJGkdm/SHr2C/GzV4XytRmptrrJqdFihKtxvXUEXWS9a4F/lkt97Tot3D7eCA1WAOu8=/,6100877.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/qRNgu6/ByKhV0kCdTZ4SIC+Hwr5rKCIVMCNgbh+Tt30XOVWyAoD+k5lN9NZ3vpS1aSJMR2aAgidoJ1F8v5v7P139GbgAZb9ne0H/p8fTsGDXassuq4tOsMZTpHY1nKLrBOAJg2+AQBqWc3QsA6f6NVzOSLdYT6zMN64O3F6AQts9/lhCmsXf7zD2CkNVrsLCO+o9yXunvCUSTiA6tRuG5vHqhSW4PvZrX+525Oga+xr456mOWdmZ/UBEB0XheghSLUX6i5ndNBOx9FFBEhx+Dal5j8KKsFB2dq9IHNghxhnE++fejyReqAR8TiY7zfku63T85LF3/9qrW+bHA0IctZPJiHfoCb2y5alD2AVtRbIE/VKEmqHbjJnCawrzzx2S6rq8Ed22SFaDmA47ae161bvbkULPhlZ2Kfd1yEhGG7M=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:40:56 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Iix/4aPziSL7UqNxq3gwL9RHFwkF03ooEZ71IA41LABqfFufgQ3mqL7q7V1CnBbR9a/D4F1srZTmsdWDbFH61YYIclfzjxNVu/mSVCy4fNU/PkhdnWKjmpcmdhzQyNOSsUAgLu8GkZ0exPGoE0VP62A5jMVW8XBOhIBTEWhUljk3Ho6Wjc6/7lAKUKJ8Vtl5o+kBecqNsZeNRqkwmCX5t4UBijeiEGm1UYyE6fdZF1DYGQPlscUL1I2qJAylUxeNOIDNGZlr0MgN3CrfFSBP36jtlIQAwO9t+2+/JAQjOuSTbwLmSyOjpcpiatJ2Tdn5PfGgdR4BR+s3r9feB9YfpZORkVBJnRRxKHryNQ/iu+u1GvlaFzfDRcJehfKCXQo5KZ2RjyyTvCB0l+b3wzXzus/6r81EN2t9DV8mQVW9eKA=/,200.0,2010-09-20T22:55:04Z,[],confessions part ii,2004

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight

I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always
Brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall

And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me after all

When love is truly right
This time it's truly right
It lives from year to year
It changes as it grows
And oh, the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall

And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me after all

Always just beyond my touch
Though I needed you so much
After all what else is living for

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall

And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down its stall
In a blizard he was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

By the dark of the moon - I planted
But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot-owl howling by my window now
For six nights in a row
She's coming for me I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

We'll be riding Wildfire
We'll be riding Wildfire
We'll be riding Wildfire

On Wildfire we're gonna ride
Gonna leave sodbustin' behind
Get these hard times right on out of our minds

To understand her -
you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought -
see every dream
N' give her wings -
when she wants to fly
Then when you find
yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her
that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her
that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
- really really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman
Let her hold you -
til ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
Til you can feel her in your blood
N' when you can see your
unborn children in her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman
you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman

our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you
all it does is just tear me down
because my heart breaks a little
when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should have bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I have the chanse
take you to every party
because all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused the good strong woman like you
to walk out my life
now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
and it hounts me every time I colose my eyes

It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should have bought you flowers

should I gave you all my hours

take you to every party
because all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say tha I was wrong
I know I'm probably too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take to every party

I'm getting so cold
I aint work this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one

Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one

[Rick Ross]
I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)

And all my niggas got that heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, aint enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, aint nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love

There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself ""Look what you've done to her""

I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you

Saying, ""Amour"" kissing you on the ear
Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here""
Although I often reminsce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around

Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love
I need love

Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle

I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do

But where you at you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug

And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

I need love
I need love

I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone

Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall

I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel

It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love
I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A playboy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation

It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch

Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands

I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

I need love
I need love

Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind and
I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I'll be waiting I love you",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009891033,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/AyXmPR6Y5mTsIHcDgbleiGxrXWoS8RA38ISoZk+J26T6WNP2sww9vhNzr5qeOuHBmNNBn9vUKDddzg4g9mQdlEs/IlKk/JX+8YrFIkKjsf8LyuSMho++0bVcpbzjyJhZR+xgeXs1TGTtIa4jXakAT/9bcf/y+KFUtB4ZfG4dAnEQ8g2/apOk7mGiMjMih/zXV4V44FnCCLyYnRCNT9MR9OrewrLR0cdx6th2JjyhLqWUZewGDzAhHmlzXs5tSskP2l0UfoelKYOJmsHAi+/v4xXEKOAPzZfwJfJXMrlkQRdHkPPDOlTqonDpa2dWSxVuu3M80PULZdJE+Y4I4SPYcmwXultjHeIO8EyJ6qW1mXa23ezz3vrsKYGX/fyhwPOq/,6777588.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/0cbrxMu51ArraDEdrYlt9YR9dg9gaQ9puET+PksKAsr3eSb6UOgZhIOcSJ+L0Q+TYE3V/c+C6eydrEAzQg26rGME+LVXu0g7lWaKDXu13/NinCINtKTzTcFTQuwt6zAFuiNkGGXlj3q/vbrG34aGp9TOMWc22l7xBwp19O/k6npsecR7b8d8KbWMXVq1IiZPCnUREBjBRGEGkAw4a91UtbcUrH5q2xNRl745ghmsIg5OvCwGY3OIzE2LrHVsNhjKdjb8vsq28RA1Hut8uC2mQ0vFMbDfubJULgbhxXO5AXNHCx8IsxQm4lt7zmT3vs3bqUzTSu+w2iScGfjtFIiNq/uRE4pNjw5P5T4lpaYYcB8A3sx+HAyrCE7xwYV91MQR/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:31:50 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/5DO2YXmtpEzgrYRJI0r4YjETXOwpp+k03/El+Cr9xnP6WNP2sww9vhNzr5qeOuHBmNNBn9vUKDddzg4g9mQdlEs/IlKk/JX+8YrFIkKjsf8LyuSMho++0bVcpbzjyJhZR+xgeXs1TGTtIa4jXakAT/9bcf/y+KFUtB4ZfG4dAnEQ8g2/apOk7mGiMjMih/zXV4V44FnCCLyYnRCNT9MR9Gsh7iu7+WPYUAvObjpqeiL/TS+nvKutR/+IK5fbPE63SH/qDOtq/rg04UL0Z+Szjfso8CbIC3VlSi3av9dhlkq5X495mAIoNzQKMxNsOyos5K3mvd2eFRJAu/cLjeOketx7UyEgDyEJJNpTkup78MGBLFJlh5Nwaj+duE98SK3X/,200.0,2011-09-05T13:17:49Z,[],i need love,1987

People were waiting in line for a place by the river

Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room

Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door they don't want him anymore
There isn't any more to go around
Turning away he remembers he once heard a legend
That spoke of a mystical magical land called America

Throw your hands in the air right now man
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah, Khalid I see you nigga, show Big Pun love yeah

I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mis-happenin's, nigga
We from the Bronx, New York shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on they face

It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad

As a young, it was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick named me, Cook Coke Shit
Should've been called Don Robbery
Extortion or maybe grand larceny

I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with shoty was the logo kid

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

R to the e'zzy', M to the whizz I
My arms stay breezy, the don's stay flizz
I got a date at eight, I'm in a seven forty 'fizz I've
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die

With a matchin' jacket 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance or boogie
So never mind how we got in here with the weapons and hoodies

Listen we don't pay admission and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it

Said he like my necklace, started relaxin' now
That's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga,
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game nigga

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelin's

Your can find Joe crack at all type of shit
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit
If I woulda brought Compton, they'd prolly squeal
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like Derick fo' real

If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These fagot niggas even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up

Kay keep tellin' me to speak about da rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about da rucker
Not even pee wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love, and do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll, can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now for ten years we've been on our own, and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen in a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter, the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

I started singin' it
singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues, and I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' This'll be the day that I die""",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009527922,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/JCMJtmXUxdChHSyAnDm61xL56ePUg+pzqqj7/yncuzgJdHT8tzFyRHoUtjx6sZXOzfxi+TGqqCfVN8MtuuJm06ERagbmRr7JTD77spR0gohON7NHUzM0cx7xJ/4ABXXzJ3lLBs7sMQfsxAFKVZg+6PbrntQRZTkNtXuGEmOMwagmp37J9cDXaoC4sEse5XJ+Im8VZIYrxxvszezOZ04v6qLVQGTgJYEfgUxJkuiY22hTWH6EmGK994OytnoLsWpFAq4+ikvYuNrdpVo0KhepwAguSfc/FkS5zOhd89w9cU9u75gse2p/QTzDWjFJW4ILN3S5/xWtfPFrYbKeY566vLJrr14DAhXSZdeuu/K1yC7cXycB9XTfMDeO/sARNVJxRZbI95ewX0LVdYFHSLK1AsobweuY27tuyxGTtV6ht8Y=/,6924369.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/DNvA/MsCbboiMH2K/tmSoSxlqqGA2UESNCFFzFzdtyzy1pHm6soT2+GmtTO5COx3FsLpl9k5ugtH38v9nCDeUU6AEJOMxPaiqFoKrKboHMC9Je9YhmhbPsHvms8hsUwRg8XSk2wQ9AsropjL3RG2tOQysXdLCZUxIoQgQyWYF2AqQ/krnks71XoTBWBoTYxRCTUjmdDcPdb8Ks3wGrQH/7CdIWEgw+xd4qAWj4F6mjYYIEWdRpu4S9Xf3xWcUY5Us1v6K9rV8pP4B4qxMnI6c7s5PTi637WGgYIywel94IxeM3c1rj4Grx9ZGMx4xcQmPD6Vz4XXVHIB9wSFty8+Evo0IU8Umxdjspf0hhrSijXTGs3jDOFMc/BRCrOcpgvXpI88Pa229s2xDXgQVGWV8Q6U35NKF0NRSmeRaMMyBSk=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:57:31 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/7WFrACSzgiB+hTXnHsBzfc1/rVia6yBz6EaLMUsz/i/SGG9DqS8WwxWC8z/oX2tq4P9TcLnk8QFH+HO0a3gbyCApvjYRObnpDQoMwkzx/U+7AJ9LsSZ52UPFMUewM7N3Lqpbm+GQufQBNUzz+34UAkYoM10DKcrzdM778Pzyozui5P9BGf63B4vVPjlBI9JSL7r30aZW2SNa6JFb+i0BIQORcrnM4Sed0fU7iMVXqGa0wvDtijrfDEimueifUnh5ZkxlEfTdRcWPmiOm9+fFZoeCxD2SMJ50tQR3LJgPPNdd2dO66GXRm2XKaRX/okW12XxmkxH3Si3v6F/QmRUBINuv/1iHafkT5b9/0SgnpmWODR1smkQZsuJu5kT+hLzlOMANsU/5l2gxzDNbDBZi/xACr+vKtJPd69w+te1tIyg=/,200.0,2011-10-28T12:47:44Z,[],american pie (parts i & ii),1972

Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop Hooray
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's the top today
Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around!

Tippy tippy pause
Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver name is Mook
I'm hittin' woodies in a hoody
Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Jenae and every hood Gee
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S & Quest, Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew

I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change

I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way

And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away

But I can't stay away form you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me, that's true
There's just some things I can't control

Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you

Hold on to every bit of hope that's all I ever do
Hoping you might change
Your mind and call me up
To say how much you need me too

And though you're leaving me no other choice
That to turn and walk away
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
You can count on me to stay

'Cause I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me, that's true
There's just some things I can't control

Your love slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you

Not many women get repeated pimpin' (?)
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused with (?)

Shake around
Get down
Get up
Do it like it hurt
Like it hurt
What you don't like work (Hey...)
(Everybody get up)

Baby can you breathe
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur
No more pretending (hey hey hey)
Cause now you in it (hey hey hey)
Here's our beginning (hey hey hey)
I always wanted
You're a good girl (Everybody get up)

I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talkin' about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines (Everybody get up)
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead get at me
(Everybody get up)
(Everybody get up)

Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me
But you'll see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

Stand a little taller
Doesn't

What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

No, don't let him worry you so

one, this is for my number
one (yeah, uh!)
this is for my number
one, true meanin for i adore (uh!)
Verse 1: ll cool j
this is hard to say, i wanna make sure i go about this in the right way
cause lately i been busy alot
and i know you don't feel appreciated and what not
i use to tell you that your hair look fly
kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
now i talk real foul and slick
every other sentence is you make me sick
back in the days i was your number one pick
now your heart's half broken and that's hard to fix
i had to dig deep inside myself
cause i can't see you bouncin with somebody else
it's a long journey back to the place we was
when i was too embarassed to admit i was in love
and you was a good girl that wouldn't give it up
i can't let her self destruct, uh uh

chorus: marc dorsey
baby smile today, cause i been imaginin' more ways
i'm gonna luv u better
and your friends will see it too
just when you think there's nothin else i can do
i'm gonna luv u better
Verse 2: ll cool j
when i think about the things we did
and i think about you havin my kids
and i think about us sharin a crib, losin all that god forbid
you deserve flowers and candy the simple things
in addiction to the sl's, baguettes and rings
instead i walk around line i'm a king
and havin you ain't nothin but a thing (only a thing)
i need to stop tellin you the lovin was good
too busy frontin in the hood
baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
i'm a do it real gentle baby nice and slow
one more chance baby and don't say no
cause i got another side to show
some say love is painful it helps you grow
well it's time for the pain to go you know
Chorus: marc dorsey
baby smile today, cause i been imaginin' more ways
i'm gonna luv u better
and your friends will see it too
just when you think there's nothin else i can do
i'm gonna luv you better
Bridge: ll cool j (marc dorsey)
do you think i meant to hurt you? (no)
do you think i meant to hurt you? (no)

god willing we gon die together
do you think i meant to hurt you? (no)
do you think i meant to hurt you? (no)
so let's, laugh together cry together
god willing we gon die together
Verse 3: ll cool j
this a brand new me, a brand new you
a brand new day, sky so blue
hold my hand while i walk with you
sit on my lap let me talk to you
no more games callin you foul names
actin like females is all the same
i'm gon love you better my mentality changed
from this day forward i'll never be the same
i'm a rub your lower back, share my dreams
i love you let me show you what i mean
give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
watch you sleep so peaceful and serene
a toast to the queen your back in my life
but this time i'm a do it right
trust me, from the bottom of my heart
nothin's gonna tear us apart i promise
Chorus: marc dorsey
baby smile today, cause i been imaginin' more ways

Let's all bring it in for Wally, Eazy sees uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody
I only rolled and blows my gauge looked at him while he lay
When playing with destiny, plays too deep for people to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please
Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me

God bless you working on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I betcha my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We livin our lives till eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

Pray, and we pray and we pray, and we pray, and we pray

Whether is tell of his Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone
Darris, Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creeping up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting
While you laughing we're passing, passing away
So y'all go rest y'all souls
Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby

Lil Eazy's long gone
Really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die
Gotta go bye bye
All a lil thug could do is cry, cry
Why they kill my dog and man
I miss my uncle Charles y'all
and he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, oh so wrong
Gotta hold on gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on (lean on)

I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while, I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings, and once again
I start to pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God

A little more than I should
We both know
I've got somewhere else to go
but I got something to tell you
that I never thought I would
but I believe you
Really ought to know

I love you,
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
but this is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's coming from my heart
And not my head

I love you,
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to
Make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to
Make you anything at all
But this feeling
Doesn't come along every day
And you shouldn't
Blow the chance
When you got the chance to say

I love you, I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment
Might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be
Leaving it like this

I honestly love you

She love the way I'm doing it
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?)
My bitch
Hold up, hol' up, woah there
Let's capture this moment if I? than I own it? Want it every mornin'
And Patronin' girl, we grownin'
Waddup, got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on?
You know I got it going til it's...

It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up

You talking to a grown ass man
It's like, way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
Err'ybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it, the fucking anthem

I don't really wanna uhh... talk too much
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half asian
And we 'bout to have a liason
She cool, get head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it's just so amazing
So amazing
So amazing

Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like I'm speed racing
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation

Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror
As you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner, and...

You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you?

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive.
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me.

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and...

You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you?

You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse, Naturally, won.
Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun.
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not you're with some underworld spy
Or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend...

one elbow, turns to his mates, who are gathered round, and he says:

Watch me wallaby's feed, mate, watch me wallaby's feed.
They're a dangerous breed, mate, so watch me wallaby's feed.

Keep playing 'til I shoot through, Blue,
Play your didgeridoo.

Tie me kangaroo down, sport,
Tie me kangaroo down.
Tie me kangaroo down, sport,
Tie me kangaroo down.
Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred,
Tan me hide when I'm dead.
So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde,

And that's it hanging on the shed.

soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers

warm as sunlight shining on her golden hair aha

I want to take her in my arms the ache is there so deep inside

chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away

and when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
am f dm g c
and my Mary wakes to love another day aha

and Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather

she doesn't care cause right or wrong, the love we share

we share together

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening

kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair

Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty girl
I don't like nasty food
The only nasty thing I like
Is a nasty groove
Will this one do?
Uh huh, I know... say...

Nasty, nasty boys, gimme a nasty groove
Nasty, nasty boys, lemme see your nasty body move

I could learn to like this, listen up...

I'm not a prude, I just want some respect
So close the door if you want me to respond
Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby,
It's Janet... Ms. Jackson if you're nasty

Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me
Nasty... don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys

Hey! Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? Nasty boys!
Who's that in that nasty car? Nasty boys!
Who's that eatin' that nasty fruit? Nasty boys!
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove? Nasty boys!

Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

Girl you don't trust no one

Give you so much of the feeling of the deck
That I'm dealing when I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in our style
So what I've come to do is kick you something fly and new
A change, different from the typical a bit more than regular
Not like the others original, 'cuz originality
And creativity add it up together equals the B.B.B. posse
Yeah, we've in the house, yo kick it

I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement.
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames.
And when it was all over I said to myself, ""Is that all there is to a fire""
[SUNG:]
Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
[SPOKEN:]
And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to a circus, the greatest show on earth.
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears.
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.
And so I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle.
I had the feeling that something was missing.
I don't know what, but when it was over,
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to a circus?
SUNG:
Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
[SPOKEN:]
Then I fell in love, head over heels in love, with the most wonderful boy in the world.
We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes.
We were so very much in love.
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't,
and when I didn't I said to myself, ""is that all there is to love?""
[SUNG:]
Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
[SPOKEN:]
I know what you must be saying to yourselves,
if that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me. I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment,
for I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,
when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my lst breath, I'll be saying to myself
[SUNG:]
Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009258986,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/B3ECFiro7+tnTvUoETbDNtzdvQRnck/AODXPc8Ye/A0BtLuvbIBSQWWm6I/Hcg/12YH3ka/gyRaLGmkKMGUuI+xBrnTeDF+3ywWS3DnFtt1rl7VgquYsl4vnTcCuCmussq2oby51O6gph9P6gjY38I4zefQMuQL1BHEvhGY8TzYacEZZ0VHigrBiRDY1C8nquhePZHqz94qffgLTeb0w+SEodw7d21gnxS6tiI/rxqy8QC+glf3Aei31QTeS8eETeIvQ3/PA/mTO3ruHny2q651xdKwJK74tNzuZgLnXKx+WFdHzmACZ0mIcSTNkkcTYuw4eki2l6C9Tt/OFBquGdzf1M0ZduwejZddK+SmJQOShTPChKrHgkUKIkWImnNJ7gNMDKNmQpF7s1wGkYFvQNlRbwOfQLpgHP1qvLlTzeuY=/,4214984.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Zod0nWcRkIGb3mdGEFWy6w26mgw+Rb7hv4Xn4qnLJNnfdG3WWGxFqqVx4wRf8g1sx8l0QplfZzh82Po2Xsf/pWv7re74w9xAGhB+o3S191Ik873EiUGj6cLlGiv+0R7URN7bX6pQTl5lKkRatH8g9SBXikMXYHVfdGkcr6vHAGyuc9gVKF9wq70WsAzEFvVo99TS70KD6U06tO7uemgJhA2emj7zD/psg/qxhz4SSozj/2AcPpcnT7mlc8aE4xLLDchXLGr4+8c78LORR0FFJ5tYcrm9O373p1LYQmtIYl17rqkjv9FzpMQShU2vU1S4smpWMlhM65+zqvSQkNveoxQEYW93cDhdZph/ZZPLS0bDdtepMmgmlFnonipn9JR9ie3OOKUe08YjDJ/gTqyyCC49ECy9cRl816tOZtfc0gM=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:56:15 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/+Zvo4WDXVybxORENwrRwwtKdY/6gFSIeCIfrqN9dBaCPvAMuRcMayRBjd7FqWukKHkrpvUe4zQL00cjS1p90yk43L/8XfkaNz9JxgHx/rm3j8GmFUVzYP8iPEMCzsMm1Ue7OcaktdXBcsSxDHSJFgpyvoc0LOtkAUGfxzSNmtLEVXDhhgZ3JnynhUcAtvoF6x9LoZ14ZROXinaZBga5yjeGaKbQpOwoMXF1+hkc/OqYUI1KbHBc4RzuuS3Y6UQT7eu5OwfXSQ3Ec/DirS3JHX+RKBBsqhzoErRHeiazyJqSIUlad5TXk70nVvMY4Ehix/1gsfe3yOCVjBtOBngFbD0gJzWn5SHEc5DY3jSr9h0jopX7m0AjapYywhMG92/Te8emzLKgblEkXfqN8xmab9sBJ9WF0OE3dJdfXPGOViYs=/,200.0,2010-07-15T17:36:02Z,[],is that all there is,1969

Armadale poppin now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid. All I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, All trust!

Only dudes movin units - em, Pimp Juice and us

Everybody's like, 'He's no item. Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!'
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2 ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in the matrix
Fuck it, let the Fish-burn
Red or green pill, you live and you learn. C'mon!

Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role

Like I was fallin' off Niagara
In a paddle-boat canoe.
Mmm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
And it's all because of you.

Like I was walkin' on a tightrope,
Swingin' in the breeze,
And though I try to keep my balance
Yeah I weaken in the knees.
I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
Lover, help me please.

Like a leaf falls from a branch,
Like a rock-slide avalanche,
Like the rain on a stormy day,
I never thought I'd fall this way.

I thought that love could never touch me,
Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky.
Mm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
You're the reason why.

Like Goliath when he met his foe,
Just like the walls of Jericho,
Like Delilah's home in town
When Samson tore it down.

I thought that love could never touch me,
Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky.
Mm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'

Till Stonemans Cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na""

Back with my wife in Tennessee and one day she said to me
""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee""
Now I don't mind, I'm chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
Follow the bouncing arm

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went, ""Na, na, na""

Like my father before me, I'm a working man
And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
But he was just 18, proud and brave

But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
'Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
'Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Well, there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

She knows
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

And we're two hearts, believing in just one mind

I memorize moments that I'm fondest of

The End Of The World
THE END OF THE WORLD
Skeeter Davis

Why does the sun go on shining
Why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world
'Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing
Why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.008166075,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/O3qIXizM1bi+FJ4ceGbSnYBzqRUZKhWyFAFMqdyp7y50awcVguMuCIU37XS/UcA8vu3iZIPI+iVeltznGOkcbbv2We4dRTTNMq7ijU5zD4i7xY9ywzoUpWa24oXaZegIeFLm6J2RfncmBxZbfDXka3XJAgzlvfFH7iZ5RAIPWGLLjWsusLvEnQonfI3jY+UPRWTMpXYiZT72hFyJCNrUrbzDg3LHIfH2UwFDYrdqbCfx1xVPaP2zn9uMcX8zDRTdD8uLtLUclz7Dzi3/5ys29hD32aBE4geWsoOC79C+liyPNi1qrp6FEA7bMHOsF7RLV6CNQX/kapBHTFguqb3fFs3TCSet4BqYmlfXCThlUXtpTV+Z8EmXujdWvxCU6vR0BTz3W3MjwCCNZcPFNO/FS3hKlWYDOdHOzu+Gu0U2+3Y=/,7836303.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ViI3cpyJgOAiRUEYo0FVITYsJ2I4z+01hLxf/6i4SbGx/Kxyco0z2MzGtdsydMfDhVPy/+7bGKsThwuNOt7W2cJwQBz/6LE3xg1tBPz/CpDPtDJIGHTd8gs2O0us4M4H9EPZnPhZOqDANKTo0DnwJiimhV4JSBqAmPROyaf/5HEqHizF4jz4Xe6J2Z9fASCs3bRXQtkGSEiuJLffvfpohASE6xPIbhwsazlOciSmT3SZxQIi01L6/oDLsXBJjfCTcko+pihiOimfK2bbgECk8fBjV0ZTNKI6B1Mv4AwlMHUoRgojKyXd8wSKCD0RzGQOzdDe6sljk0/MRxkFfWScT6JKjVcIkI05lzBJ80N4vIKd3lmHviDBnGPwoUrVL/4oPOoId+q++ypnYabFisz2ZRhKK2ZDdPLFaJ+XY0Jt5yI=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:52:09 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/K6Gz4YWh1PKcY3PjAwc/CBh20/cfZcOCUjL+/pncaUrfpobfkx9dKdLK14ogsk11H2y88MS0oMoqIV5QG/JQeg20FSurmHjxsu8YtbdcSf0/sZcZuk38Wv3uL5GRmtYM3THvbsFs7Rtux6wbutFGyuVgeGtg3s5lFQYRITAwWwZAev52oqnubDL10/06wg2zlSVha89p981cK1HZwa5agQiirIhbv9z+dAqGXVdDPTac3UVABvd3XobtSZe8RIinsPMNWIWbE26f0DcuajCEU2BAbb6724t9LL8A9xFIAcfoY9fKNk/MchfYy2bl4hnyU4d5xgHG3oqleSniTWY8562umPwzQvNtfrmCqwHtDLLJQt/NlVmDsjAuVBUn15TI0SfbwPbTSqmzcEuEMRpPsJpGpEYtrW4yz4jiQ3OiHao=/,200.0,2012-11-23T23:05:11Z,[],the end of the world,1963

You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two...
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before...
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true...
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true...
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head...
The stars get red and oh the night's so blue...

You know what that mean, I'm fly to death

Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus, yo my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Something about Mary, she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dali
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

Ok, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a bandaid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin, co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yup!)
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

Why don't you do what you do when you did what you did to me?
Love was so good that it filled up all my needs.

I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me

How could something so right go so wrong

my love
sweet love?

Why don't you say what you say
when you say what you said anymore?
Your eyes couldn't lie
so long goodbye
close the door.
I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me
how could something so right go so wrong
my love, sweet love

Tell me something I didn't do

Why did someone else have to pull you through?
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?
Love like this must take flight.

Why don't they play what they played
on the nights you danced with me?
Remember the one we made love to endlessly.
I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me

Why don't you do what you do when you did what you did to
me?
Do what you do when you did what you did to me.

Like an arrow through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter, baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)

I'm rushing home, just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes feel so g-g-good
So I'll tell you baby

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend (baby)
Send it in a letter baby, tell you on the phone

Miss you much, I miss you much

To tell the world
I miss you

And fill my nights with song

Could it be finally I'm turning for home
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone

I can't live my life without you

Every time I see you walking by, I get a thrill
You don't notice me but in time you will

'Cause if you do, you'll lose a good thing

'Cause what I've got to say
Is sealed with a kiss and a wedding ring
(Wedding ring)

I've tried and tried and tried and tried
To tell you how I feel

I'll Be There For You
Chorus:
You're all that I need
I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me,
I'll keep it real wit' you
Lovin' your whole scenes
That be in there blu
On top of that you got
The good power you
Shorty your man for you anytime you need me
For real girl its me in your world, believe me
Nottin' make a man feel better than a woman
Queen wit a crown that be down for what ever
There's a few things thats forever, my Lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nuttin',
You made a brother feel like he was sunntin'
Thats why I'm wit'cha today, bo, no fronttin'
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on the back and say
'Baby It'll be okay'
Now thats real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away
And keep it tight, 'aight
And I'm gonna walk these dogs so we can live
In the fat ass crib wit thousands of kids
Word, like, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'm make sure we
Be livin' in the fuckin life of luxury
I'm realizin' that you didnt have to fuck wit me
But you did, now I'm goin' all out kid,
And I got mad love to give, You're my nigga'

CHORUS
I've got a love jones for your body and your skin tones
Bombin' it alone, I'm already in the brohm
Plus I love the fact you've got a mind of you're own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up north, you in the world rockin'
Three fourths of quart never showin your stuff off, bo,
It be true, me for you
Thats how it is, I can be your Noah,
You can be my Wiz, then I can be your sun
You can be my earf'
Ressurect the God through burf' lets believe!

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody
I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know
that I used to know
I used to know

Say it for always 
That's the way it should be 
Say you, say me
Say it together 
Naturally 

I had a dream I had an awesome dream 
People in the park playing games in the dark 
And what they played was a masquerade 
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out 

Say you, say me
Say it for always 
That's the way it should be 
Say you, say me
Say it together 
Naturally  

As we go down life's lonesome highway 
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two 
A helping hand - Some one who understands 
That when you feel you've lost your way 
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you"" 

Say you, say me
Say it for always 
That's the way it should be 
Say you, say me
Say it together 
Naturally 

So you think you know the answers - Oh no 
'Couse the whole world has got you dancing 
That's right - I'm telling you 
It's time to start believing - Oh yes 
Believing who you are: You are a shining star 

Say you, say me
Say it for always 
That's the way it should be 
Say you, say m

I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving,
Suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid 'cause I think they alway will.

And I'm looking for space,
And to find out who I am.
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream.
Sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair.

All alone in the universe,
Sometimes that's how it seems.
I get lost in the sadness and the screams.
Then I look in the center,
Suddenly everything's clear.
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams.

And I'm looking for space,
And to find out who I am.
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream.
Sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair.

On the road of experience,
Join in the living day.
If there's an answer,
It's just that it's just that way.

When you're looking for space,
And to find out who you are.
When you're looking to try and reach the stars.
It's a sweet, sweet, sweet dream.
Sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair.

Sometimes I fly like an eagle.

(That's life)
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

I said that's life
(That's life)
And as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stomping on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
(That's life)
I tell you, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
(That's life)
That's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it

Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Now your ghosts have gone away, oh

But there's something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

Ooh baby, I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
What we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?

You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part

I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell

Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay her and watch you grow

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Yeah, because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.00988698,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/rysYH3Sunn6XtqUEuln0MN/qesjow0k1dO07+a0UuaGXgq29agx4tWPj/+mDU+fG/QhWLoHlknNLNTzck4I9Q5kOi0SepAKYICCszN4QU0paFxYt12zdGJNUXe/mG4rQiQhTxbYMkaMlyk5Vlu/50HcmFguKB5U88kyF5JheMMWEaV1cAym6/cU2HZ9yHvsSyVOmqVESQnPaH8+79+fwRDyMKg06lqNK3CEbMoN0w0DX1PHhWAW4u/Yf/9o2g+AYlbE5ptik6gn0pw6gFs54jI1qsF1C35suSuGHp20gG2V8IJbWtBshfy4k1pbziTEz0cymuu06q095utCMabnMsmCKrTqjqVKuHIFoyAsU8lNMvbrfXsGmZdEOr29eURdO/,1410963.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/5yM8XxEQj1td+yWyqWBcMmWTTYeiKJz3MvocEXCYVedDfawMfEYZkY9YDwUNP8uAyeVWSTRq66N1kmbujZS18hAs5Q5e0/TCBqRhCGHkahnoaeBR02rPppA9PEoW/UdiM8UvP52fpFIePz6cRIdjXGvGpw4JreCUPHOAgqHGKabBxNzW8DvLrJY7miHSkZqkUZQwA8F75FOcws1txJ55GRziGtPSgwDWMpenGNKPcEY7lPPCKLWb9FS9j6JLs+Fg1DPtx2L64JhPbpMWFDml5TCZxMDId/m8tx/xSUSwFrUYuTa7ZUrjjp5tahsCiAoFYV2+TKl83Y0DQ1e5mQMT1askuo2DxKcbaY9Uihk8LVSM4WmN/9OoGvDbjJ2srp6W/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:58:49 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/LTjMW99lldFIHTPEjW2S96mpkQx3zxPybiI8/ff/NOUwqJLh8JdLpSeAXtITiqm7lrQxZC/Q7yYs1HwSMGSwQMmOvpe5RedtHt98+wWKgS4IZ06gEP4OPtET9w+RpC4LgTVPVtObBP4X7MqgQVQui/a2xwJ/tlS6FK5aUAjii3IsUYacS8LblIJ7WUITp4c3SNp3f5aIeP228n4dFki6XEWnAqlDtWaSfyQZ7KHRmd1C2mYucIJ/mY9MFO+d49wvedxNR5/mUINx5zKJGv4wdVTFfnJKrSJKN7nZsPRdBk33QIK3dARJnRK9omtfE7RpU9ir8s/Wwoh/jWqncjfIkXP15qh4h6bsX2aWzLXMBE6NH91Zc//NCM3YoGzqVKQ6/,200.0,2010-06-29T04:53:15Z,[],my boy,1975

I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years
Through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had
I've always been so glad
To be with you
Through the years
It's better everyday
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years
When everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belonged
Right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about
By loving you
Through the years

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around

Like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was taking it hard
Oh, she wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl?

Well, the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My Tears are holding back
They're tryin' not to fall
My Heart's out of the running
True Love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like Heartaches
And the winner loses all.

One day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'
What the final result would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And thinkin' that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
I came out in second place.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.005843163,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/dTzcM/ngvp+quXo3B5PBbRGBXAntdzInhhW2D9tliSfKcW1KPpWVMHXC6IeAIsUjRrcszkDnyOR1c7iaFybClVmzJVIwFEm0CXwO3Cbf5H1VBJYp2QX8S2UVkLmeUJNVM/yu7rPcoZny45dW6b9ad1paPwv+ddrsNXMe9cw/wnLoMaqjUrY/xlv8sKOZ1Yr3BqVYKIZ7/gnHLs9xQ/zQc1zX2LIBWGsg1Vyx26QImA4mp3tzLJhUOltxRtf6+U88SJTWvM6yda+yXkL9i4Ioq4DYq7LLtXycz1r8MmmTpH/VvVls96L4s2BtArHm2MYYIcIBvTIxXSPjI/6d2RQA3ZJsz/2vhSVDw9aWT1A9cNDehdeMcMm7FEU/CcEVyJu1AG5E5vXLIYnvMGCadVjK23aHUQ+GVDJa26Zowtri5Wg=/,3281441.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/n7XF7uEIXeEQtLZKmgLNeiGGDUeuovsMANOxbWN863wesHXUhpDa/kQVFfT5YqeBWtIHLuiask5ZYh/oBk4eJll/pLYCealHpfC1NTNDsdbmGqWR9LewvuI+RVFRv3ZFkIWkuXsWbcKyCe9fy0XsZkPFGJGCZgEtY7emWHSw2ucYYkWwC9cbvHqcn28I7hqyhxlZ8rp/iyCEvOed4HwEd2SoqNO+xl6IZ4WN6RTxUHI6R4lWnMdytwO7EnQbEHA53AAFnnmNvVrRAdMBgUkVcHAOkA40wCanpOAsKu7fltqj7jYBzl0xbBD9t0UoJ3+19yBD7A5u/98MyPD/f7I/WbM+W5ZcnmZYKLYMxpAIZau9qz3jQ8rdQl0fCd+ghueysihkORe7BlAeCiz9I/DzEOcUMsgOXco16GuuAD8kenY=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:53:30 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/vOn+9ilUUlEyh0iheLawmt10NcJVJ+3uR65DISlGb2+fv7PE9M43njKR8dje3rt/skBRHZ7T6Qudz2Elo3NL8yxo/IHShcEwvO+PzlLsN5s/GRVZWeOM0Y6kkneqHfm/UWf8BoYAs850YY6fP5x0wxPT8q1u0k4iRywRci9zwFrQn5Kq+OzNOwvh7+xTSdC827ZLGWi/ubMYuaT/rUPmOmJv2djw6/SAxO3OGgOlDFR6lC4wa63LEQ//nBeS6/a9qQVS9HdQAxtGoBSUdqKV9dxG/b5t9CFaDcXUb6dWLbHCP1ZCqW1FTZg7ywHYKDWbDBOCLPjOLeHVrYJyP/hRhDw1R2hmN3WJ/1NnuEC5JrTRbdELJpMl1e3hprqJfCcBdzvcwkNRCHZ0R3/BmgPPEqVq7ZFZ2EQGfY1ja3TYxnU=/,200.0,2010-06-29T22:43:00Z,[],the race is on,1965

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair
And walk with me

All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

Then softer than a piper man
One day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days
They go on and on

And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind, warm summer wind, the summer wind",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.010365963,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/EQuNWIQDw9oqgm269VR64xF9IIKMDsf5sRY+ignyPwn1MZjaCONPAzWa95cBRhdgcu4b2wxgnpj0zOgoAhjYGK+4g2iJju22RLCNNJ9aGLFYzIDBj92KL7CssgdudZxd14Ru/wgkBmNKsUaLqAPe6JChxXQC+BYQqjIEexyQsZYwsICsJ3nIyPueUYGgjYXcAH4Mjx2fTDHcOVeH76vxu8bgNaHUQhNvL6BTXRobxn7QQVQ3HOSWoLSOIOLVKBMvWxC+IgYglaeGZQvjIUrDHHxrRvdtwoLb7u/QzLaPRaRvOH0tqz0mxaeo78igLjpjWqxmnRAkVMbnkA0hNisQxVs0+9uxpWt9QaZMEPBKIfT1uuRXRcHRY3j36TWrdLoK/,6734908.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/XBEqWKsz0rK1FSpxW1Af4qz8yyvvEFUzg8AwcAgru4MR1kJYmQ71p7okT2i9zVM+hCTIBOPYw+oK4ra0tmRIHb+LQFdcsWnMpdnOfbKQM3V7U/kuy1qaAYQ1+jLQ0g7PNGWSB/YJ0PYqYxhCaIzQNZzm3twmFdN92iqzq3L+S/es6igJ/MTxYe2GGFvfhXBvWIqIZ0tF984ziy0iafsdk5SZ/jarrYc/CZA5IIYvn80L7bYGalKTzINwMgTXx4M5+/fkMDpzVVO8ZLv+OzUrkdKT0hbUIgVyTuWeC4Cv8tJrarH+gALNORH1aem/sC+rX+oLuvMD9BNPkfAvd4sw3rni/wBF0a2BhBnIlYRgz+9HxtgXDhs659xMq4Pjw+SY/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:54:26 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Kwr+lp3oGhAGi5N0jVq33Ap1VCgk65wIvgAE5nV+J5t2G6HzBP6ZeWOpZBqAOaShq5dWbOE0LsEkpNnjTZ8P1n/NlsOE1Gchf6CBkLVeDq4nktoqJ+yshCLae5zWjqO2L8+ajbBdEIQwA3ovNk5LHpPUssTmRcWntrz2riRcheYSwY+bHXLs9p/UUyois/OHrujbebkO04TOBfV07Tqmru7jj/c5sv1pPFdCISzdI69wtjMYSioZfwxlySfQEmf3TJf0NZ9RU+NuCBtvAxs8VstSAg15z7vQjNbW2XsRVMduooOtGp9ViIxTo+fdlA4ziS/A3JLMlmGgeLOlIl5MkuDhEVVhxKOsp+/ZeZ6Xe9/ByaKIwqtqpNUtbN727uhu/,200.0,2011-08-22T11:58:43Z,[],summer wind,1966

Taught to me
A long time ago
At my mother's knee

She said, child, someday
Someone who loves you
Will make you cry
Though he loves you
He'll hurt you til
You feel you could die

But if he says forgive me
Forgive if you can
For you are his woman
And he is your man

When you're looking for roses
There are thorns you will meet
And remember, my child
Without any thorns
The rose can't be sweet

Well it's finally happened
Now it's my turn to cry
Oh, my darling
You've hurt me
Til I feel I could die

But you're saying forgive me
And I understand
For I am your woman
And you are my man

Don't tell me about heartache
I've cried my share of tears
I've had my share of rain
But after the storm
No rain will appear

I just know when you hold me
My whole world is complete
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns
The rose can't be sweet

The lesson is clear
Without any thorns
The rose can't be sweet",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009653807,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/o4v2fbIa57IhUdg3m6Du5ZcapPm1rd5+Z5lucI2lpmX+EofQnlUgezPUBZKtvrNmQwu2L9KMIgWUuf3kcjKojiHNAvPlDZ6weN1v/Ff0ct67MsNEsgt30zBzunhRSEnQV64GRvbw7yB0ET+Ov+LWSWQ64R7uiGU/CnvkB1jAj0DVfuTHZiD5zoVCMfYfq3pJ3KEjg+/VkDyHoj3bpMkWeUQY/GRaIV/0Bm4jDDFoVY6EEKEJUUnZ1f3aT63zhjVjHgmQ9VPSsb8snGrxZFqTXNz61jMbtp5M8AXKCnMBCET/z07LiprsAgQCBgk/wrpzoRigkmHXWj0ljzyOLR9/DA57QA6yO8hhyZT39V4jbVdO5FQMnVKQD85ESFowDcaX/,6804392.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/dttxkXneJGQ/PMJgUmvde5tHsxVNImNwQeq3E34ysQXWWNY1nuqtzKhaXONFkYjyshUHnu6OQ9eMwBlQxzPHQm6K5hgeHfS7uN0OG93JPKGRak1eqwT4vX8cQtXcqhaujcTmal+LR+uvMDamMSV6Auv+td8ty+2r7YVaM96UTdl91lNDIHutO+F4b2xoD0d98N0h2kcawJq6veh1LcomiNdZWzvT5vR6F7cxvXS1f2GFQb2AO3ciPqFy6IYh1GA88hLDhNPKNoZe45M+K5MlfY/Li7nVmsFOGN6yB4dUPNgevSlHkg5Dew42JxJdD/Z7WbJXazFRvK0G4BNNzvZnMKFN4u0CtygdMbfNREB3wIoTULOA5F/5nXPLg3to7eBL/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:55:18 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/rTLqkVQIrtFiZbAbv4A+fprTwj8a7GLWs+svgq8bV05r+gLFzyYH5SWrRPugYVcYKGhRffi2THwixXyS5mUoybbzj1UD/ygsWMCHzbwqGH4cMDJs6Ikdae4RXXhiEeip7DB90tBIIsxbMxK54A8VxNKtU3CPyC9IGMg00dKt46QOvJpxedstIbmzbO0FZmqjmh/CRzeLuCzA0S9Q9sEu5mr5aSovNLxyy37JbkY8xPqkvZxHnegef1vXEiYTfp7wkTnPiyq3yc6UwDGULsqX8uQ71z7fiNz1dnKXc93FQFwt+f4kguvSIhpIZOETxEqCR+K57a85qI/NoxS6k5IiCo2HNMMKNS7oaf7jHIeSNyV9jKH5QhVjBvco8H9QmrQq/,200.0,2011-09-12T14:19:56Z,[],the lesson,1968

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out

And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Nelly hang all out)

Hey, hey, why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
(Come on)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' a sportscar, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, and do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flipped it, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cuz baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin' it's hot up in this joint
Vocalk, tanktop, all on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, ""Girl I think my butt gettin' big""

Oh
It's gettin' hot in herre

So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Stop placin', time wastin'
I gotta a friend with a hole in a basement
(What?)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason
(Oh)
Unless you goin' do it
Extra, extra, eh, spread the news
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptune
Came back with somethin' thicker than in Sasoon
Say she like to think about cuttin' in restrooms

Keep you safe and warm

There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong

My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

And I won't break, and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break, and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again

When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight

My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop

And I won't break, and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break, and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again, alright

And I won't break, and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break, and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again

And I won't break, and I won't bend

Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes

I never realized

Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

Miscellaneous
Love Is""(feat. Vanessa Williams
[Vanessa]
They say it's a river, that circles the Earth
A beam of light shinin' to the edge of the universe
It conquers all
It changes everything

They say it's a blessing
They say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is
It conquers all
But it's a mystery

[1] - Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard

And it fades away
So easily

[Brian]
In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In the blink of an eye babe, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the lovers for eternity

[2] - Love breaks the chains
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And then turns it into the beauty that remains

[Vanessa]
Look at this place
It was paradise
But now it's dying
I'll pray for love

[Brian]
I'll take, my chances that it's not too late

[Vanessa]
[Repeat 1]

[Brian]
And it fades away so easily

watchin' the sun bake;
All of those tourists covered with oil.
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing.
Smell those shrimp--They're beginnin' to boil.

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
But I know it's nobody's fault.

Don't know the reason,
Stayed here all season
With nothing to show but this brand new tatoo.
But it's a real beauty,
A Mexican cutie;
How it got here
I haven't a clue.

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
Now I think,-- hell it could be my fault.

I blew out my flip flop,
Stepped on a pop top;
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home.
But there's booze in the blender,
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.

But I know, it's my own damn fault.

Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were

You know I've been waiting so long for this chance...
Can we talk alone?

But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

Verse 1:
Little lady you look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say, and
Tonight I wanna make you mine
We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time, oh no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight

Chorus:
Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
Cuz I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love...
No...
No no baby

Verse 2:
Sweet lady
Don't you look away
I don't mean to make you shy
But we haven't got much time
Tonight I know just what to say, yeah
I'll love your cares away
And you and I will find a way
You know that there's a possibility
That we'll never get this chance once again, oh no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight
Baby tonight

Chorus:
Cuz I've been holding back what I feel love's so real
But I can't wait another minute

Cuz I've been hnolding back all I feel

He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft, but then his number came up
And he was gone with the draft, he's in the army now a blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he could not jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar
In boogie rhythm, he can't blow a note unless a bass
And guitar is playin' with him and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

When he played his boogie woogie bugle, he was busy as a busy bee
And when he played he made the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
Andata toodliata-toodliata toot toot, he blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
'Cause they know how it goes when someone gives him a beat
Woh, woh, he wakes 'em up when he plays reveille
The boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

A root, a toot, a toodli-a-da to toot toot toot, he's blowin' eight to the bar

But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down
When you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time

I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want you (you should stop frontin babe)

But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove

A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore
To shore to shore

If there's a shortcut
I'd have found it
But there is no
Easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday, we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard

It's such a lonely
Lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by, tell me
Is it worth just another try

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Tell me, are we alive
Or just a dying planet
(What are the chances)
Ask the man in your heart
For the answer

And when you feel afraid
(Love one another)
When you've lost your way
(Love one another)

And when you're all alone
(Love one another)
And when you're far from home
(Love one another)

And when you're down and out
(Love one another)
And when your hopes run out
(Love one another)

And when you need a friend
(Love one another)
And when you're near the end
(Love, we got to love
We got to love one another)

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
(Shine, shine, shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free

Tears in my eyes, you know sometimes
It'd be like that, baby, yeah

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride

Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny

So, baby, we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby no
Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go

I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Going it alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving but going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

I'm searching though I don't succeed, no
For someone's love there's a growing need
All is lost there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone who cares
I'll be looking every day,
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
Woo, hoo
I'll find a way somehow

What you've got to know is
What becomes of the brokenhearted
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the best I can, girl
Woooo hoo
I've gotta, gotta find her
Mmm mmm mmm, gotta find a way somehow, sugar

There I stood in another line
Tryin' to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood

Standing right in front of me was
A little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes

And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful, if mama meets Jesus tonight

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the cashier said, ""Son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me

He said, ""Mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without""
Tell me sir, what am I going to do
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes

So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
""Mama's gonna look so great""

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful, if mama meets Jesus tonight

I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me what Christmas is all about

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful, if mama meets Jesus tonight

I want her to look beautiful
If mama meets Jesus tonight",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.006206036,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/uAOblf44rcK18FSACv0bN0aoyle15X4JWk96eYIMcij08/J5hZKmyNdmM5qCZlEEBvN2spgOtKMvV6DUaS/Rs18ofJJ0RBbHlsItl6zNHSKYpzipyFZ2BR3hpYdVdgymNIuS/W+F1d6Nf2ShOT9HFhjfQqV4WZVc32im7/mCTXd9yaWIulfnncactVr6vg0R531DEKb80fIQxku4/p8E1neaPQW3siej1Ww2Lyp87btR+g52EnyU3/gqCPXWquXRHVMKrWTPECDkVrD1SxZl9+3i8iLMdQCnXTFdOzuky2CmSs16EAFku+xzrXDQp7IOjP5cveTVXJ7cMSNAApKM+MQ8Lm3yF6HlBm8OafN2NIO1Li1QnrUdlEj/wcPCQ4oWsO/hmAkSRfzjyN85reJaRBLpKpnA1SK1ujDXQBFFd04=/,5988514.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/5MTdYaPbLsewVqj3vWEBmlNRkqklnN2cfQYUH4qecvXoAy9w+X/rA9dqAtW0h0GL6gGVhat4f5OP+xxJV3beTFjRfkUp2BZcDKKjNd3kVvqWZntFKVmnm1roUoZ9Qb3JxDBjy9oU5nPOLIhgH4w5tBfjLHSCgUkrN5HeDycptmb8KglZmnJ2ZUJYQdWRx1OlYXgEIFvC4R50ZRaEDCedM5BBPKdhpS0j5ov/5h1jw+uEPcuqWg+70dbCT9bAYyX0aF115EsrHYefZfPz0AZL3I/O3M3yZCZ3DxtsCVC4924hslXTftMt+xH5o0r2pmO4ko/trfBdNyzfmbVGnPzJZ+FvYUpVYf3YNkgkD2wO1Zh3b1vd183iYnX6rxGw5itq/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:10:18 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/zlfv1Uz+6rlDsgZ1qABGC4ijk4fnfXtvaYnsm1862PtrSGe6QUou0bJmfNY60pAF2EOE2sLX035hiTS5TgLX59TczIXScERtEx5FbIdSWxixdH3SN5VZo40WZmryo5RfMdspZIYqd26EeRB3lB7mvtLi8kzebwYkcGgwwXfpR4kLc1lBXbL/myTCXoH4rYmx2UYjGkqLqkaX3pts0vepBwFJP1W5YIv0G1XNrmaMIdVApHSf/9aw/lj5IBa3kekqd8s00OvBKjJeAdlF4En+0haAEW6X06cgg99JrW9EmPWOF7bFZ2SiVsQAV17UADZi68dFjk9oDXPhOJh2IP5i3Mgo1khpLHgLcQZ1Kv0V/IZCLYKbaD+dxMOje7VJToqh/,200.0,2011-02-09T04:21:39Z,[],the christmas shoes,2001

When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Till you tell me to

Baby tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go

Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job

As he catches the poor ladies' eyes
Just for fun he says, ""Get a job""

Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them

Said, hey little boy you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do
Said, hey old man how can you stand
To think that way, did you really think about it
Before you made the rules?

He said, ""Son, that's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them""

That's just the way it is

Well they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
Because the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar, no, no, no

Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome.

Walk into the club like ""What up? I got a big cock!""
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like ""Damn, that's a cold ass honky!""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like ""Ah, he got the Velcros!""

What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?

One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, ‰Û÷cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor
then you might
Come to believe in me.

The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me.

Those other loves that
came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me.

Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
that's spoken
And love's never wrong
when it's real.

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me.

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing, and
There's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to be persistent
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would've never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.010823965,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/TAEw5Q/Gl6sKS68fq1taE7nBRkF60G1B/NTOPO7cTqkE2qyYk87t5yPbmxIit09jWGN2+VOIqTQDub1PFTlquZ3dCZM1XqHg3DqhhVO5LoC7YGKX59ISYJJtbv9bQk5VR+/aK6RwdOQuPG7lQPnnPAzkp/UrOPsGVOToV8uGk9nAOYaEhApTxLoaz4M2rLXnVkrKIYeU2UlGajg/5+WSGz2cS6XUrgP7G7IezQm1UmNnIHFvhh1nyYibeshJcpWeuX3bSYWvXKkQHqw318E0TqEzBQU4kra7D1m3NL59oEmZKw99ikwKDUg5CQD3OcUi8e1NGK65DTSytjLoo759YcUXLKcz47AfnveCoM1SHrVafa33cZcM7TqVBWHA31+0/HCsYnLUvR+GuzT8bjbm5j5av1J+0xHoEK/eVFklgR8=/,6229225.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ahJqr0QC7LXKlJn/guTIvfFr18mRJNfM75X49Od641TB+w6N/KEFhJMFQLv4KoW8FkGVQO3TH7BgjPAnuyAXnmJHC0i0mwBGagOewH0SxJbu6H8PI7mKw6uBO+xG1lh+erph5WOC3/ehIMgtxLL7ZVSAH25WYNzfvk/Iy9UkVQfFidpS5/KkvkjOrDRJFEa0sK6MVHeOmM1mP4gQ0solD+AQ9XfcAuQDyhopqWa2fLpMKFsE0o0ZqHOorhjwATuCilrUFdC3Q3asNJdtXl7D/qlUH1qc0I76mOknVVoEULmcOH/M9wbvnbgMi3/Dgi8wtiikCTltxy5qdvbLa61toOeMfb0bK3J2v8q72rV6U285UGjxx3I77DUV96T/0dSRfYGPpQG98GdgnbS2djudipIoLk/koo8sqR9nHWbdFhw=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:12:55 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/BBPpSyy0bLF5VFYL5vNnTw3aWIH6ONVXrNWyOizsCkkCSFOdjU2qK0Snq3YLYLxrfKdBSihL8reCpwNpG8bParGYrZ5ee2b7WODHIaGLT5tjXIc2gQgJ+MmsdnqzTOP1dn+7YxTtapUeb+TSm4Hr7lJxWWWWrK989z+XbgjOjca/RhoTYQIBD1Axqjmp03qdR4Jp1ooD20X7Ao4SzNzCn+OECkthCcRwFd+YAnciZFOM33tGOHMdWDoEF4joxvGxpuc17rjRxuWBj+WMszDHZ1puYeTs+NU0e1qEVGtJB+c1lDwkPvP5916F4biOP85i3JQH+9QT0aDJMrSzcw3BQuv1uDC7dVyQaHWP+M2aarHqsIA4g4T/VCNWJaj2gML2ycEw4Cn+ct5sH6cGo3ZdjNFMdTMplJKTgYs49wjSiFo=/,200.0,2011-04-11T09:32:30Z,[],waiting on the world to change,2007

And as we lie here
Just two shadows
In the light before the dawn

And I have never been afraid of losin'
And I have never wanted love to be a chain

You're my sunshine, you're my rain

We're not children

We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores
But all the heartaches and temptations
Only made me love you more

A highway in the skies

Maria
(Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Oh, my Maria) Maria
(Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
Maria, I love you

My Maria, there were
Some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you
Bring back my peace of mind

Gypsy lady, you're
A miracle work for me
You set my soul free
Like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight
When the skies are grey
She treats me so right
Lady, take me away

Maria
(Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Oh, my Maria) Maria
(Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
Maria, I love you

Maria
(Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Oh, my Maria) Maria

Please come to Boston for the Springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lotsa room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafÌ© where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
She said ""No-would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy now wontcha settle down?""
""Boston ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
""I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night till they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said ""No-boy, would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy why dontcha settle down?""
""Denver ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
"" 'cause I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""



Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA
She just said ""No-boy, won't you come home to me?""

And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy why dontcha settle down?""
""LA can't be your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
"" No, no, I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

""I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava 
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up

YNV, SCC, [This is how we do it] all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)
Check it out!

Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

Oh I'm buzzing because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava 
(This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because [This is how we do it]
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
(This is how we do it)

Oh it's party time
(This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West side
(This is how we do it)
OG's got the flava, yeah [This is how we do it]
And Monty doesn't like nobody, doesn't
(This is how we do it)
Come on now, Def Jam, you know what it
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it
(This is how we do it

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal

Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day everyday)
Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she's the one (fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been...

 Lobo
 Written by Sam Lorber / Jeff Silbar / Steve Jobe
 
 When your eyes met mine,
 I knew that I had better play it cool --
 I'm doing my best trying to resist
 Cause I ain't no fool.
 
 Where in the world did you come from baby?
 You waited just a little too long
 To look my way.
 Now it's a little to late.
 
 Where were you
 When I was falling in love?
 I was looking for you, baby.
 Where were you
 When I was falling in love?
 Looking for you, baby.
 If I'd ever looked in those eyes before,
 We'd be together tonight I'm sure.
 Where were you
 When I was falling in love?
 Where were you
 Lost and looking for love?
 
 If I'd have met you sooner,
 I'd be talking to you and playing the game.
 But the best thing for me to do
 Is get up and leave without knowing your name.
 It might have been something special, baby,
 Something only people in love could understand --
 Like this ring on my hand.

There's other fish in the sea

Cute (cute, cute, cute)

Hey Deele - sing

To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Just Because
Anita Baker
(Micheal O'Hara, Sami McKinney Alex Brown)

When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be, sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'

Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you
Just because you're you

You're a diamond in my mind. a treasure found
A precious gem to me. you're so nice to have around
I'm so glad I took the path that led to this
And it's amazin' loving you, I'm doin' things
I never thought I'd do

I don't know, there ain't no explanation
Of why I'm sharin' love at last this way
I won't try to work out all my reasons
I'II use these words to simply say

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby.

Could it be that there's more to this than meets the eye
Maybe that's the reason why
All I know is when I'm in your arms it feels all right
I'II hold you tight and I come alive

I love you just because
I love you just because
Just because I do, my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, baby, just because you're you

that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out...

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why...
On that morning
When this life is over
I know, I'll see your face

Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)

Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every time I pray (we miss you)
I'll be missing you (we miss you)
Thinking of the day (we miss you)
When you went away (we miss you)
What a life to take (we miss you)
What a bond to break (we miss you)
I'll be missing you (we miss you)

Than enough to just be here today

If there's a melody, I'll play it!

So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it.
'Cause I'm gonna sing it to the whole big lonely world!
So turn your radio way down low and get near it,
And I'll tell the world
I love you girl!

If there's an ounce of love, I'm gonna give it to you, Babe.
If there's a breath of life, I'm gonna live it,

Suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye

I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all

Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me

She chose to stay at home
So they could be a family
For the children but what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
And she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22, either way it hurts
Someone that you lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

And I, and I
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me

snow is softly falling.
Dreams are calling
like bells in the distance.

We were dreamers not so long ago.
But one by one we all had to grow up.

When it seems the magic slipped away,
we find it all again on Christmas day...

Believe in what your heart is saying,
hear the melody that's playing.
There's no time to waste,
there's so much to celebrate.

Believe in what you feel inside,
And give your dreams the wings to fly.
You have everything you need,
If you just believe.

Trains move quickly to their journey's end.
Destinations are where we begin again.
Ships go sailing far across the sea.
Trusting starlight, to get where they need to be.

When it seems that we have lost our way,
we find ourselves again on Christmas day...

Believe in what your heart is saying,
hear the melody that's playing.
There's no time to waste,
there's so much to celebrate.

Believe in what you feel inside,
And give your dreams the wings to fly.
You have everything you need,
If you just believe.

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best

You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had

Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
You know I'll be over there
(Yup!) I'll be over there
Shorty, I'll be over there
I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'
I'll be there as soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin' room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused wit cause

Baby, you my everything

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin'

Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong
Just to have something to say

I know the moment isn't right
To tell the girl a comical line
To keep the conversation light
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind

But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
Cause I'm just avoiding the facts

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide

And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

Even when you talk it takes over me
You're so dandy
I wanna know
Can you feel it too just like I do

I always seem to get around you
There's no mistaking; I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you

I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you

Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy

I attempt to look my best for you

(indeed I do, just for you)

Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do

You sure are sweet - Sweet!
You're so dandy
You're taking my appetite - but it's all right

It's like candy

(ooh, vanilla! chocolate!)

You look real nice, wrapped up tight
You're so dandy
You're giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like

It's like candy, you're so dandy...

You're like a brand new feeling
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day
And wrapped up tight

(so good - so good)

Strawberry! raspberry!
All those good thangs!
Violets and gumdrops
That's what you're saying to me

Sure seems like good candy to me

Brothers and sisters keep messing up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?

My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)

Rasha Don and Baba? They went down to Peachtree.
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes.
A game of horseshoes!

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place (Home)
Take me to another land (Home)
Make me forget all that hurts me

Oh won't you let me
Won't you help me
Won't you help me understand you plan?
Take me home
Take me home
Home
Take me to another place
Take me home

Headliner? I won the game of horseshoes.
Now you owe me a watermelon.
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks,
do like they do below the border.

No it look like the roots of the tree my ancestors were hung from.
But that's okay, get it, 'cuz he's down to earth.

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meetIronic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think cause I'm...

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody
Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be overtomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hooI
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
And I'm coming straight at MC's, blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at, pumped up feeling
And shit to say back to the kids who play 'emI ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that, straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts, I am nuts for real
But I'm okay with that, it's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

As hard as I try you know it just isn't fair

When you brought the sunlight, completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude 'cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you

Because without you beside me I can't survive

If you're keeping me warm each and every night

(So lost without you)
My every wish and every dream
(Every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
(Brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude 'cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you

See I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back, I guess it shows that we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate, and care for what we have
And I'd go through it all over again to be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
(Lost without you, baby)
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
(Whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude, sweet baby, I'm so thankful I found you

Thank God I found you, I was lost without you

You're gonna be a star some day
You're gonna make a lot of people happy

I don't remember mama
She died when I was born
We lived in a one room shanty
But daddy tried to make it a home
When I was only 6 years old
Started singin' in the streets
People would throw me pennies
So I could help daddy make ends meet

He said, ""Keep on singin'
Don't stop singin'

You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play""

He said, ""Keep on singin'

So spread your song around""

By the time that I was 10 years old
I had a little rock 'n' roll band
Daddy's eyes were growing dim
But I didn't understand
He would be so proud of me
Each time he'd hear us play
At night he'd pull me to his side
And daddy would always say

He said, ""Keep on singin'
Don't stop singin'

Spread the music from town to town

He didn't have much money
But things didn't seem so bad
I felt just like the queen of the world
When I was with my dad
Then one rainy April night
Daddy called me to his side
He held me with his tremblin' hands
Right before he died

He said, ""Keep on singin'
Don't stop singin'
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play""

And he said thing he hadn't said before

Each and every moment searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me

Starting again is part of the plan
I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can
May not make it easier but I have felt you near all the way

Ever, ever, can't nobody stop me, watch me
Ever, and ever, stand on the rock of your
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me, yes it's shining on me
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing, you're sharing with me, you're sharing with me
You're sharing with me, you're sharing with me

Cannot be in the dark, make it into the light, yea
You're love is shinning on me, shinning on me, shinning on me

About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner takes it all)
(And the loser has to fall)
(Throw a dice, cold as ice)
(Way down here, someone dear)
(Takes it all, has to fall)
(And it's plain, I complain)...

Tell me what am I gonna do
About this fuckin' threesome love affair

He'll be freakin' when lookin at your
Pretty titties in the air
Something about the way you switch that ass
When you're with him
Lookin' at me I can't believe he trust us like he do
Bloomin' dozen all that shoppin', takin' trips
While I was knockin' ain't no secret
Why i'd end up lovin' you

Down low, down low (gotta keep it on the)
Down low, down low (keep it on the)

Gettin' busy in the back of his Mercedes every night
Answers the phone when he goes home
And let him know that everything is A-OK
Ooh baby, damn this shit is tight
Passin' blunts to one another on 35th street
As you reminisce and tell me what he used to do for you
You makin' plans to be with me while he's at home
Meet you at college, baby this is where we do

[chorus]

Don Perry is what we're sippin'
While we're trippin on the fact that he's not here
It turns us on in every way
You say you stashed away some money for us
When you leavin'
Ooh dont tell me
When I look to see another day
I try my best to walk away but everytime I think about
That sweetest love you're givin' me, I hesitate
He's out the front, I'm in the back
I locks the front, he's in the back
And I'll be damned that silly bitch is screamin' LLAADDYY

Sang love's refrain together and we'd both pretend it would never end
But one day we cried together, cast love aside together

You're gone from me but in my memory
We always will be together

Oh darlin', the memory of all the happy moments
We shared together will always remain in my heart
The picnics at the park, the boat rides on the lake

The way we danced all night, the warmth of your kiss
The way you held me tight are all part of a tender love
I'll never, never forget

Like the times that we spent 
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent 
I laughed and she'd smile 
It would last for a while 
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again 

Listen to the mandolin rain 
Listen to the music on the lake 
Listen to my heart break 
Every time she runs away 
Listen to the banjo wind 
A sad song drifting low 
Listen to the tears roll 
Down my face as she turns to go 

A cool evening dance 
Listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill 
From the air till they play the last song 
I'll do my time 
Keeping you off my mind 
But there's moments that I find
I'm not feeling so strong 

Listen to the mandolin rain 
Listen to the music on the lake 
Listen to my heart break 
Every time she runs away 
Listen to the banjo wind 
A sad song drifting low 
Listen to the tears roll 
Down my face as she turns to go 

Running down by the lakeshore 
She did love the sound of a summer storm 
It played on the lake like a mandolin 
Now it's washing her away once again 

The boat's steaming in 
I watch the sidewheel spin 
And I think about her when 
I hear that whistle blow 
I can't change my mind 
I knew all the time 
That she'd go 
But that's a choice I made long ago 

Listen to the mandolin rain 
Listen to the music on the lake 
Listen to my heart break 
Every time she runs away 
Listen to the banjo wind 
A sad song drifting low 
Listen to the tears roll 
Down my face as she turns to go

-----

When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
And the hot sun chills me to the bone
When I can't hear the song for the singer
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
And the stars start to splatter in the sky
When the moon hits the southwest horizon
With the scream of an eagle on the fly
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And listen to the ripples as they moan
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

Black muddy river, roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll

When it seems like the night will last forever
And there's nothing left to do but count the years
When the strings of my heart begin to sever
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
And dream me a dream of my own
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.007951020999999999,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/AH8Cap63iNRr54JDWX1tZ4IoMCPsAGEEHaEXa/T/S0vsV69+qdVVLhWGgPveUGP+/Z0P57uZuST1k7zV22XAs9o+XtSiJCw8l8JjwEcieArE2Znl6NZn4iVVN0CQ/ap41QeTdszwd2r8Vgokdj3sQN8O0tsMLQyaKBgu/vQCblh22q8T+ATji5Oi/KOTAhrGccbYop6aID0E4x2x6Z4tfbNjmNRrHhjSucd0BjjgJZGkaQ+Vfx4NtJEguNZjlBErGeG1pO3E1dePp0Eu+5ONCj4lhpQd/fn1OlHvJuNHwkxwexhX5ds7pUTK+3HWsOTN9OgmTath7m4qIZ3LQ+aIU1vdT0LWEi4WQNsxOt+AoRaQxQjwWSO7nlH/jkUmiDrkhrOBDKm28KSKRo2DxQokMBn6KrgnbhOsWzkADCw0nH8=/,5760731.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/IcpKqsa4EA2E3ycE+933rR/PTheoEdAmAuyfyL21MutVTQyChKR+dCGIMgNycn90RFsw3lh3cBTiTGH28Q9dE1kFPwLIf0619jjQnMfUhPrrVYqko/+9F1KwSBPRFvE8O7/EWgn8pu0KeTF1RLH3MIWJx20/BZT3kscFMMZ1xZgt3PZeWbNFDVRiy8GLm9fxASaJ5Lmqg2ig5s8Y8syb6f0/6RAUTqsNrZOCCJADUdCN8gX4OuudrojixPrvmi2q4FlvqLMRgO8ngxbz3rDUqI6FxMKTcDVv/RgmurfmjR9DbxyAVVym4pF7jb29q5zGnhWP4BtIwUV7E9TZEhHxtwhHueLMh2AcO+exSD0PbeE+DsGZ+LrcjDhFADIsr9+Ql5MLbdZ7qzXJe92mWLsX0Zo1ffrNYgQv8tyTvXt7MTE=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:03:40 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/0mlrjARBP68a5T3ijiG5jcf4hFFWYX0naM3XzyR/i7TsV69+qdVVLhWGgPveUGP+/Z0P57uZuST1k7zV22XAs9o+XtSiJCw8l8JjwEcieArE2Znl6NZn4iVVN0CQ/ap41QeTdszwd2r8Vgokdj3sQN8O0tsMLQyaKBgu/vQCblh22q8T+ATji5Oi/KOTAhrGccbYop6aID0E4x2x6Z4tfbNjmNRrHhjSucd0BjjgJZGkaQ+Vfx4NtJEguNZjlBErDulXhWn98F7Y4g+t1/hPduO40fuYRWDEG7PmE9ZFU+0JVxW9zW/oR8CJQi9J5PH7aBnfqh1A/tX1og8Zah27VM7iMFyCy5dWSGc+bcYiYCZ4FdW59KiTRWm44ISIjIJpwv0LXHn5ABlpBBDLFBFM1PkadF8AxZ3hJQR0Tlf72Kw=/,200.0,2010-09-13T10:34:15Z,[],mandolin rain,1987

But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

When we finally say good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
But as long as you love me so.
Let it snow, snow, snow
Let it snow

When we finally kiss good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

Oh, the weather outside is frightful,

And a sweet talking ladies man

We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking

With the hole in her stocking

Didn't it feel good

Flirting and flirting

Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through?
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away boy

I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me!
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy
Here today!
There was so much you gave me
To my heart
To my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away

You'd tell me this was love

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for

So tired of broken hearts
And losin' at this game before I start
This dance I'll take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance

You are my destiny
I can't let go baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it

Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied
With casual encounters, I can't hide
My need for two hearts that bleed
With burning love that's the way it's got to be

Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You
I could never forget to

Cherish is the word
I used to remind me of your love

Keep giving it, keep giving it to me
Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy
Give me faith, I will always cherish you

How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

Songbird sings from the heart
Each word can tear you apart
I sing you sing along
You find your life in my song
When you need the strength to carry on
You've got me to turn to
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
They've helped you be strong now
The song sets you free
But who sings for me
I'm all alone now
Who sings for songbird

Sometimes when I'm all alone
I sing my saddest song
Lonely and no one can see
This time the song is for me
I can touch your secret place inside
And still you don't know me
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
You've learned to be strong now
My song sets you free
But who sings for me
I'm all alone now
Where is my songbird
Where is my songbird
Who sings his songs for me",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.007914065999999999,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/8nOhkB+wFcelsSQJzElV5jyfnH6saVFEm1q9L9pde6r2iVL7+1C+8qDydsVmoaz6yYNMENxkmCNPwVnsmcFbNwP7HEXNjgYqx4JJT/Gq3saRO/uV2MRgmOtX9oKuqhLWaq6ASILDI49IJ82ObSu7f6ezUhZQSusQtzMbcdTzeCb/jfe0G7B1j6uAdiKVO66pkTlq3ogM03wh7vd0mmdcJK7Ip8XUb2zHxAM3aVbACuyHXZvKErsx06T7ajm5osUk/fGRssuwOS1rz98zspX65eDCJT5/YKBMrhQFO+wF1Pgu/4wmLvJYzKT0lzCm34Xo8iZD/eJZB/WvwGmF1P4wFs+4/XWWOUYoM/K6Ri+vZmzDAgHAVR/EqqW+8b71owME/,1237349.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/oMsDnLAq4kOLBwiQGt9CRGc6jonVGv5str2FL1WX2DM3nDgNnPmW2q6xLgdCknAJQ2+wcBniu+WD69E0lgMX6pJRB2csGX5xb8Od+Jo1Y8Z0FvIcCmR0SWhB4ZDUJfuhl/vuU5EXSgsCmMX3IMyrucYAA6PavzrBiLYuyKXuRrbgxoT8U8zT55vhwFHy+9UO4Z6Mrk6XIJbGY108m0M+TYbHMFt+Mw81hHYUvRFv9+vIE4n2OXGCFc0VAGsM0Y8CXikXHoo8rgM0hYVwpuCU121ndtD6pbLHbOFGOkk2XpZfPZTT6MsT4kKwVxmgK9w2qQHgLh1BqO9vB1xCYiwkxOGHK9NZe63s/CagOQhB9eDLvDikR3TsHrvT4jhAI8we/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:00:09 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Jiso/zgVSNL5UW5FTR/LZ8QUJj8ekv9reM+skE54udSyKVIsBdQOaA1zwE0CaCFg0/Q0QhCkgQFE2qlyHMKwrQP7HEXNjgYqx4JJT/Gq3saRO/uV2MRgmOtX9oKuqhLWaq6ASILDI49IJ82ObSu7f6ezUhZQSusQtzMbcdTzeCYQyTsHQ4I+qc+iUZ+9wtbsb0ZHzVdp30OwHvXRGJeYAxaYRSxNe5tJ1D33/LMZXDI/eq+S6zuyx4BiJmWICWvdP/rObbw80/FrXfEdU1umtWyVC2yMhoEu6+oKBzqx9636KBjW/iQCfNnd2vVX+KS/O/dSbEzlTRmlT1iyikFD7ZuI1fPEfRoYtsoyoaD3aYJ4GBMqf9GfcZH4m21BSkxT/,200.0,2010-06-29T03:14:03Z,[],songbird,1978

And darling, I know what the remedy should be

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

As the day goes by
Thought weighs heavy on my mind
Only thing I think about
Is tonight the lights go out

Ooh, and I hope it's you tonight
But not just tonight
Every day and every night I want your love
Hold me, sweet, sweet love

So I'm telling you my problems
Because I know you know exactly what I need, woo

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

Ooh
Come on, come on and squeeze me, girl
Warp, wrap my body
Warp, wrap my body
Real tight, yeah, yeah

Girl, I have to solve this problem out, baby
And I know what the remedy should be
I need someone to hold me
I need a woman right here, right here next to me

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me

Fred Knoblock


I'll take another wedding in stride
Here's another June wedding
I'm sittin' on the bride's side... again
Why do they always have to play that song?
You know the one
It's funny, but we never get to sing along

Her daddy's got her by one arm
I used to have her by the other
At least until she found another lover and then another

Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together
Why not me?
We had a real love
But in a flash, she's gone forever

Well, I think we're all here
I see Bill and Charlie
No, wait -- Eddie got smart
He had a golf game, and he just had to go to it
Why do they always have to ask that question?
You know the one
Should I speak now or forever hold my peace of mind?

Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together
Why not me?
We had a real love
But in a flash, she's gone forever, gone forever

And the ceremony is grand
But old lovers never get to make a last stand
And I held some rice in my hand
I let it fall to the floor
I just don't care anymore

I'll just get drunk at the reception
I won't think about her twice
I'll just say,? Congratulations. You both look real nice, real nice.?

Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together

You're gonna know what it means to be blue.

You're gonna know how it feels

To feel your heart breaking in two,

When the wheel of hurt come wheelin round to you.

I'll see you cryin bitter tears one day baby

I'll hear you sayin you're so sorry we are through.

But I'll be the first one to help you

Because you'll need someone that's true.

When the wheel of hurt come wheelin round to you.

You're gonna learn the truth the hard way,

But once you learn you'll always know;

That it's bad luck to hurt somebody

When the somebody loves you so.

It may be today or it may be tomorrow

You'll have to pay when your payment is due

And maybe then you'll realize

Just how much pain you put me through

Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories

Time after sometimes you picture me, 
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said, ""No""
But I found out darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by you will get to know me
A little more better, girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid to let your feelings show
And I understand but girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

No way, no how I swear

No way, no how I

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie...

Mr. Cheeks, whoo (I'm talkin' lights, camera, action)
Oh Kay (Get down now)
Big dawg now one shot deal shit

Yea, OK
Now I'm in the spot where I want to be
Money spent, niggas gettin bent, chicks in front of me
Just the way I like it, hunnies turnin' somethin'
I got a seat up in the cut and I'm burnin' somethin'
Booties dancin' 'round a nigga and I'm killin' one
Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at
Lemme put you onto somethin'
You fuckin' with a big nigga, no frontin'

[Chorus: x2]
Uh shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin'
Fuckin' with me for real, it's gone be somethin'
Yea, I'm talkin' lights, camera, action
Had me singin' ""I'm sorry Ms. Jackson""

I love the way it's goin down she got the thong on
She started bouncin more once she heard the ""Thong Song""
Them high heels got them calves lookin' right too
Shorty come live with me for the night true
Shit I'm only tryin to holla, it's only right you holla back
So where you headed lemme follow that
Now word up I got plans for you
It's more than my tongue and my hands'll do
The way you move to the music - it make a nigga want to,
take you up outta here, go somewhere, loose it
And your physique is off the chain
It's gonna be hard gettin you off the brain
I mean we could take a drive in the
I mean we could take a drive in the
I mean we could take a drive in the
I mean we could take a drive in the
I mean we could take a drive in the
The way you boogie on the floor, know that sex slide
You's a dime piece, I'm tryin to see somethin
Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin

[Chorus: x2]

I got a few hours left 'til a nigga jet
And I'm hopin' that it's you that a nigga get
Hear them callin' out ya name, I geuss ya showtime
Get'cha money shorty, lemme see you pole climb
Toes out, back showin' off the tat-toooo
Fuck the dumb shit, a nigga had to snatch youuuu
Lookin as good as ya smell, pay your own bills
Ask officer, 'cause your pushin' your own wheels
Yea I'm feelin' you tryin' to see the deal with you
What's goin' on, later on, can I chill with you?
We can do anything that you want to do
You know the way a nigga feel, all I want is you
Get ya dance on
Love the way you make the moves with no pants on
Let's ride!
Bounce to ya man's song
Let's get to goin, it's goin on before the chance gone
Next stop

[Chorus: x4]

Yo, turn with me now
Do my thing, hey swing with me now
Big dawg now, one shot deal shit
Keep it tight, and this is how we steal shit
It's that real shit, it's that new shit
How we come through shit
Mr. Sexy keep shit hot with us
Let's go get it, niggas tried to come get us
Back, niggas know my fuckin' style
Got the booties in the back, hey meanwhile
We just suckin' and smokin' and drinkin'
Hey man, what the fuck is they thinkin'
Aww shit, we's high tonioght
Well my nigga said ""Let's ride tonite""
We out in Miami
We in New York
Twist the cap, pop the cork
Yea shorty, lemme see somethin'
Fuckin' with me and my team, yea it's gone be somethin'

Poppin', watching big momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

It's the B to the O W
Wow even your girl fall in love
When I smile
The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the hype, just right for you size
I get in where I fit in
Braided up, made the bucks
And I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'm ma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple of mills
Shining every time I feel
You see how so so get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the wow, in your ear now
I get down 'cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With my arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn sixteen I'm ma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a nigga like me along time ago
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

I, I, I wanna see you bounce with me now
Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

It's the same game
Played in so many ways
Everyone is the victim too
It's just a waste of time
Made for simple minds
So why do people insist on lies

I'll give my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Getting caught you in a vicious web of lies, they can hurt you
And destroy you, you watch out for lies, just a devil in disguise

chorus

The nation's leaders as well as teachers
Practice lies as a way of lie, yes they do
So think before you speak
Cause what you sow you reap

The truth will always come to light
Will we ever learn one day
That telling lies always bring to matters
Misery and sometimes pain

chorus x4

rap
Lies and deceit
Yes it's running real rampant
Communities suffering, yo I can't stand it
When we think of lies we tend to think of politicians
But what about the husband who's on a mission
Lying to his wife so he can get it on and get some
Coming back home with a dumb expression
Written on a face that he's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude
People do you hear me, don't listen
To a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair
And we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And everybody's tale affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold
I guess what Debbie T. is really trying to say
When you break it all down we're all the same

I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim caught up
In a vicious web of lies

Wondering in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through.

Something in your eyes was so inviting,
Something in your smile was so exciting,
Something in my heart,
Told me I must have you.

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little bit we know
Love was just a glance away,
A warm embracing dance away, and

Ever since that night we've been together.
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right,
For strangers in the night.

Not my goodies

(verse 1: Petey Pablo)
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there
I'm the truth
I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
Cause they seen me do it
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back, pickin' out baskets of fruit
(I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freaky Petey loves you too
Ha, ha
You know how I do

(Ciara)
You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for
Sexy, independent, down-to-spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

(chorus)
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Maybe cause I talk about it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

(verse 2: Ciara)
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You think you're slick
Tryn'a hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

(chorus)

(verse 3: Petey Pablo)
So damn hot, but so young
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the bag
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam da bam

(verse 4: Ciara)
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryn'a get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

Say goodbye to not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say goodbye to not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

And I'll remember the strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you saved me
I'll remember

Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember

I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned to let go, I travel in stillness
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
Mmmmm (I'll remember) mmmmm

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me

Now I finally have a reason why

Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

(Chorus 1:)
Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain?

Everywhere I go, I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart
Sometimes, it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

And I all alone?
Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me
Where I used to be?
Is there any chance?
I just can't believe
You're not lonely, too
Just for me and you

Can you stop the rain?

If you were here for only one night
Baby, I know you'd remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together
Together

Won't you chase my clouds away?

Dream of the good times that we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on
Living in wonder, thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
""You're so young"" is all they can say
They don't know
If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl

Too many walls have been built in between us
Too many dreams have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up, they'll still never win
Deep in my heart, I know the strength is within

Watching the others, chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart
Thinking in silence is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind
My time has yet to come
Until then

Too many walls have been built in between us
Too many dreams have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up, they'll still never win
Deep in my heart, I know the strength is within

Ooh yeah

Too many walls have been built in between us
Too many dreams have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up, they'll still never win
Deep in my heart, I know the strength is within
Too many walls have been built in between us
Too many dreams have been shattered around us

You wanna act now

Never call me back now

Forgot what love was all about

Love has many ways
Of touching your emotions
Taking control of you
And even in thought
Love can make you change
There's no way of controlling love
When it's part of you

Well you could be a married man
With two kids and a good woman
And you could give your heart and soul
I swear it don't mean nothin'
'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

I'm telling you love
Boy, makes things happen
You never know where it's coming from
You never know who you're gonna love
I'm telling you love
Makes things happen
You never know what you're gonna do
When ever true love takes hold of you

There's never a time
'Cause love will let you know
Love appears at the worst
And even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own
There's no way of controlling love
It controls your life

Well, you could be a faithful girl
With a good heart and good intentions
And you could never leave your home
I swear there ain't no preventions
'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

I'm telling you love
Boy, makes things happen

When love takes hold of you
You can have the purest heart and the finest attitude
But I swear that don't mean nothin'
When your heart's under the spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

I'm telling you love

Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me, we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get an old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight, is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through

Let's wait awhile before we go too far

When all of the stars where shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together

We made our very first promise
To love, to share and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile, our love will be great

To save some for later so our love can be greater

Remember, I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you

In that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon?
It seems like yesterday we were hanging
Round the hood
Now I'm gonna keep your memory alive
Like a homie should
A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep stepping
But I can't get past the pain
I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think and I
I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

This is for my homies

See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean
This is for my homies

See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

My God, my God
Won't you pass on a message for me
Tell him put down those dice for a second Lord
And listen to his homies
Could you tell him I'll never let go of his memory
So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back
I said God's got his back
A lifetime of memories going down the drain
I'd like to keep stepping
But I can't get past the pain
I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think and I
I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

You know I miss you
You know I miss you

Dialog:
This song is dedicated to my homies in that gangsta lean.
Tommy, the Master's touch...
And my boy YB...
And my boy EB...
And whoever else out there got a homie that's in the gangsta lean.
And also my boys in the pen that ain't gone never see the street again.
Cause you know what?
It don't matter what they was doing when they was here.
They could have been banging, slanging...
But they ain't here no more
And that's somebody's daddy, somebody's baby,
That's somebody's homie.
So go and let them rest in piece while they in that gangsta lean.
You know what I'm saying?
That's on the real, Loc.

(Chorus)

I can't believe that you're gone.
I'll see you
I'll see you
I'll see you
Now that you're in that gangsta lean
Well well well
I'm so sorry you're gone but I've got to keep on
I've got to keep moving
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving moving moving moving
I'll see you
I'll see you

To let you get away from me
I'll regret that move for as long as I'm livin'

To open up and love you even more

I'm never gonna let you go

I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see, it's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more

3430,michael bolton,1411624196,http://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1997/adult-contemporary,7/19/97,adult_contemp,"I have often dreamed, of a far off place,
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me,
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face,
And a voice keeps saying, ""this is where I'm meant to be.""

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong,
I know every mile, will be worth my while,
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong.

Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you,
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through.

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms

I will search the world, I will face its harms,
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.0069439409999999995,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/1INVuIdQxeOE9VDoktYWZzVQYZbzCtDy16ooiG4+nCXEsPUjaCIi74yLUp+Phm8jKofDZC7XosiU/mJWTfLuT4jPEi9RhCBfJ20g6RnOphN2zfniERmXYj7v2kB5fTZ5WNsOrgGi1iqoMhKfuAF41QsLdOsq5jpcaFqRIcNSVu04kuLJRjfwE3TAdRXL+b4aNKKNF2QP2hPu963LUkNPhMscyJCWbn06aknDkngIuezO1AyeTpjf1l9M3LGa7Urxs1VqZzzN8eCX/6KIBFTJ5RgkR8CT5/NIB6vLCRnlbBWvG64xrEgJ+F/yULD9liDp6KA1S9pAl5hk7e3/xKlKgLtsD7X5HOoDY0MN5MmDkXrGIv4g0DpKAWnGCmGLS8GlnI2zRTrbIuQ+Qb+YcouwmGwuus1+j0oh3yauDoKgy7Q=/,6386669.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/5yYD2ulYpW/qved6XRwz/3fu8IIVeH5hhuo1Ro8kR6mJTeR0OZ7K+dLn4LjvZrFt6aO7X0JLfUPuz3BfIfAmBk1PLRHoHA69Al3aUNM+wAymw6WVhotT06aI8Kmq/SMdqa2h92Cc/DPXFHhhnp+H+lh1u5UW6YmWughxzqoLvXfolEdQ76TaMNBCXr1EcA2MBfN+M8LGi1Xe7moKU1kOwSkflgq+L0NJbOBtIHzqGs9qv015ZmHiFvIAWq3nlDRGIkej1VDseYgsVoJ3IyKo77brGMr/HTMhdmfJy/AvXV5JCGsE6G4OaRw34Y3otFPMDPvayy+thqY40ud26YcuShczzNzHzJJEsrgAcR5lE2juI0YFaOdoylzn5Oze8WhEJmmn7roDhiOzuhABYQr/yezxqOkxkcqMkCH+7t+luVg=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:08:07 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/6b9q/ql31SYg1ObkpbHUvqxl45k8ZBsVPIXtF7Pe3H/7SoeOmtXe7dlDBP+kuJY6nINlEEk3YJ9lAYAp3gnpGCaxPn+X4QS6WXhhy0GkJ1t0ODhzbdv4m+TucZCFxwYoprLqEQO3NU/QEZAAMd4tESat8GzX2WZamxnh+z/QUnLOZlcmHOgCG6J5jX2bIp5Bj/naWVvzFE4T/ogCnhn+kxsMMcdGWkW8K2geD+DjayCkNQEqWBe/LXNNCw36PT6jWR1bQGgZ4zfqva9IxZzM6SMCX85lscvWLhPinfAU+fNpai7HWM2O9bYYRlcSQ/ZBB3oW5idYukefeWu53lkoBpDJCYU5PqD3pfpC4Le+HhX2pJR/zXe9FD6c5EsMmggSdMBMmAeq7ECbvhuiyq5H16aQWEXhihF6nWqhJAhiu4c=/,200.0,2011-06-10T16:13:12Z,[],go the distance,1997

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?

Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends

Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'

And then you use my cell phone
Callin' whoever that you thinks at home
And then when the bill comes

Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mommas number's here more than once

If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above
Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I've not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below
Anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am

For the strength to stay away

I feel your fire
Then I lose my self control

And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

Everytime that I let you in
You take away something deep within
A fool for love is a fool for pain
But I refuse to love you again

How can I ease the pain

And how can I ease the pain in my heart

Tell me baby why you're here?
Knock, knock, knockin at my door
I can't take it, no more
No more, no more, no more baby
Give me all or nothing at all

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

When some silly girl had set you free

I wondered what was wrong with you

In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

Because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back

Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Babe, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I

You're all I've ever needed

and walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I've no regrets
Can't you tell from the look on my face that I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast
The love I have for you
Time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end
Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget.

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love
Oh when we fell in love

Girl, I live off how you make me feel
So I question all this being real

For the first time I'm not afraid of love

How can I love you when you ain't around

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow
Is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
And that cannot be reversed
You made the rules, and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power
Of you, love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young
My heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird
Take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

Lorne Greene

He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
But under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my knife
And late that night I saved the life of Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . .)

I nursed him till the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
Then from dawn till setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

One day we rode the mountain crest
And I went east and he went west
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror near and far
With lead and blood he gained such fame
All throught the West they feared the name of Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

I knew someday I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me ""We're even, friend""
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo

(Ringo . . . Ringo . . . )

Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Drench yourself in words unspoken

I told the bitch I'd cry for you, I'd die for you, I lied to you
But getting the pussy is all I tried to do
It's me Kurupt bitch, and i'm a rider, I'll ride ya
Roll up beside ya, serve ya dick like an appetizer
Tasty as fuck - ya know ya wanna fuck me
Bitch, my name's Kurupt

I told ya, see gotcha ya Feenin like Jodeci
It's Dat Nigga Daz, bitch did ya notice me?
Yeah, see we out with tha crew, when we chillin in the back bitch
So what ya wanna do? (Whatcha wanna do?)

(I wanna fuck him,
I wanna fuck him,
And I wanna fuck you.)

So what's your name? Devante Swing...
And that's K-Ci, and that's my brother Dalvin...
And that's Jo-Jo, so, whats happenin?
Anything can happen from the way these hoes is acting
I see it like a picture, It's all up in my mind,
See all i see is ass, and me hittin it from behind
(I wanna uhhhh--ahhhh) Pumpin like the old days.
Bitch ya got your hooks in me just like the O'Jays

[Chorus:]

If you come up, get done up... inside let me run up [x4]

Come up to my room

[Verse Two: Jodeci]

I recognize you
You was in the hotel lobby
You were lookin damn good
I was sweatin' at the after party
I told you to go with me
I wanted you to freak with me
Keep the message from your mama
I dont need no drama

A piece of mind
A piece of mind
A piece of mind
Is hard to find
So dont waste time
No, no, no, no, no, no
From the side
From behind
In your eye
How ever you want it
There's no tellin what I'll do
When you come into my room

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]

I'm feelin kinda lonely tonight
I need someone to do me so right
(I'm lookin for a woman, i'm lookin for my baby)

It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why

I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

So many people love you baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition

I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

But I can't love you this much baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting
(I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting
(Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

it s starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
to the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we ll be fine
trying to convince myself I ve found one
making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)

So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I think there s a areason for it all
you say that you re nothing like the last girl

that s why I mma take you anywhere you wanna go

She said to me
The answer is easy if you
Take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle
To be free
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover

She said it's really not my habit
To intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning
Won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself
At the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

CHORUS:
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said it grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again
I said I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways

She said why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me
And I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways
To leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

Then you came to me and my loneliness left me

That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Now that we're here together

Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better

And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart

You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz,
Would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said ""It wasn't me""
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes,
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

From so far across the floor now baby
That's nothing new I've watched you
So many times before now baby
I see that look in your eyes
And what its telling me
And you know, oooh girl that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy, now baby

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (well oh well)
I can give you all the loving you need
(im gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We'll go all the way to heaven

Ooooh I've been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do? I can tell you've got your pride now baby
Come to me (well well) let me ease your mind (oh babe)
I've got the remedy, yes I do
Now give me just a little time

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (well oh well)
I can give you all the loving you need
(im gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We'll go all the way to heaven

Girl, ive been missing you
and you know its funny everytime i get to feelin this way
i wish i had you near me, i wanna reach out and touch you.

I can't stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me baby when I'm holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know your near
Then you whisper in my ear (oh baby)

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (well oh well)
I can give you all the loving you need
(im gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We'll go all the way to heaven

Yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in TriBeCa
right next to Deniro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and... since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them Pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what's up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from...

New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York,
New York

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
8 million stories, out there in it naked
City, it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three Card Monty
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah""",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.007727146,1.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/hAblljtrwJDXOQfIjQ955cWBOfljs4qXacbvh5J0hHBM3iEXAHE2Rb4X0nD9JtatQZ0iHwCtGd5uIPXH18zMFou6pOdNV8SiEk+bY4oaWH+LnnGSABW9XDFoZlhB/lwuSViFcqUtwAoS6Mxgx/SQ1y0QJqlVBpyHXUUz7eOj5jjvzvZARa9pzd0tClRRGk92kaYf0syPYySfXwzmOoyeraSnTtYjlKEsuKXeZqjDe4uzh8txIJTVrD3OIfQWDHFpEozmDhL2BL63//pjovvhe/mB58aj7fIC8awnHADaN4d20N9n7G9NCRYingqRWpWqT7YYckhxPl7tsTDpZ4zzrviWmwI2zJtpR53Jh6XXjIKRICgN174eN5gB+VM0F3hVVkFxrBJRWTv6x7XCXYVLj2xs6+TReuE+vuIwiqN1QGY=/,8419913.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/exnfZcdJKnE5fXwueb0CGfvTYQJaWTUuXUAhoFC1Ig6NCmKE+iS5M43ywuAHaOQF9EVt/fQ4jlEvDhIeNxf5OsBYeA1Gx7kaQKMappxRSg8KZBZtfw12gWF3iIfkv8ie0LzjxuEGUgH5WgbFRV58uZ2HcGiL1rvuaFRpLhWvj8Lsapnoxiedv3IzwD0wvdBvc0djUz9IqF+lDWzck6CtNi8/FqIRwOoZ40xV3gD255CKzBHzn6825JHuv/SvRm5H81Mc5bZBNolzTPYEiDM3ncjQDPzJUgmxkkD11vKWgzxu+jHAMomRvXt553dCaVPT+iPSfupHnxT5n8FVS+Q0bQRZsTn941okDorLGkY++oMqJd2MG7YLY62EQMiU8+rwXbsG9OdwkAYo4gMYsasboOd2x2e9A9ZQIKccHH7+/40=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:44:09 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/21IuNSI3BFZF2m60Jegu/40cowX5MpEInAHS4iYHhmJva2qFNHCAYeECMfYFyulXjMadV6qZlLKeVhFRp3Q6hxwDgFVYCzYL9sYcH/Y545wYnHq+DLYZ85o9sLHegyrF9PrIBpqvtx3F9UJMbzDqk/KbcShzkCAjFP4uAKx03nEPdgbusYaajlYLZ2lBwOApNtBqZ94LB3yZtu+CL4nTHsh17uTrQ9lm7t5NSEJN99Q/tpN079+zN8wDXvDxN2p/iszELB9FlNgiVfZsNEqFCnPO+Rthmd2NdYk33ypGQPsp9xqoM8M0/jDsDc0IjeOITR70FOvG7fSAVwzZK9AKmWQibUrlU3lqxCLSH1ALyE9HYZqlpTU83p9j8Qwk0GVrmTnCbSHdK+YqlJhx2ctOTfh2q9OK3d2UQZLzdukL0/I=/,200.0,2013-09-09T01:02:11Z,[],empire state of mind,2009

On the early train
Well I could say, ""Everything's all right""
And I could pretend and say, ""Goodbye""

Got your ticket, got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
Oh, I could say, ""That's the way it goes""
And I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

We took a taxi to the station
Not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know

Feeling humble, heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear the whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know that I'll be crying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

(Even try)
I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why?)
I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try?)
I'm always here if you change, change your mind

So you leavin' in the mornin'
On the early train
Well I could say, ""Everything's all right""
And I could pretend and say, ""Goodbye""
But that would be lying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you

(LaTocha):
As I stand here contemplating,
On the right thing to decide.
Will I take the wrong direction,
All my life, where will I go,
What lies ahead of me?
(Tamika):
I have strong determination,
And I'm not afraid of change.
I have yet to find that someone,
Who would care to satisfy me,
To stay right by me.

Chorus:
Who can I run to,
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?
Who can I run to,


To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?

Verse Two:
(Tiny):
And my mind is so confusing,
Who would be that special one?
Everyday I'm trying to find you,
All along, I've got to know,
Is there a place for me?
(LaTocha):
I know love has many names,
And a message very clear.
All it takes is time and patience,

Oh I could hide 'neath the wings of the blue bird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise wipe the sleep out of our eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings.

CHORUS:

Cheer up sleepy Jean Oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen.
I once thought of you as a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be.
Oh when our good times started then

Life goes by
Every day's a brand new sky
Every tear comes to dry
All that really matters in this crazy world
Is you and I together, baby just remember...

The first leaves of the tree,
The way you look at me,
A thousand chiming church bells ring
The simple things are free
The sun, the moon, the stars,
The beating of two hearts
How I love the simple things,
The simple things just are

So here we go
Let's just dance
Teach my soul to take this chance
Put my heart in your hands
Out of all the moments that we leave behind
Turn around and tell me baby we'll remember...

The thunder and the rain,
The way you say my name
After all the clouds go by the simple things remain
The sun, the moon, the stars,
The beating of two hearts
How I love the simple things,
The simple things just are

Oh, The ocean and the sky
The way we feel tonight

there's someone in this crazy world for me.
The way that people come and go through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know.

I used to say, No promises, let's keep it simple,
But freedom only helps you say goodbye.
It took awhile for me to learn that nothing comes for free.
The price I've paid is high enough for me.

I know I need to be in love,
I know I've wasted too much time.
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world,
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find.

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions,
But none of them will comfort me tonight.
I'm wide awake at 4 a.m. without a friend in sight,
hanging on a hope, but I'm alright.

I know I need to be in love,
I know I've wasted too much time.
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world,
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find.

I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee
Has it's sugar and cream

Your eggs are over easy
Your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss
That used to greet me

Now you say the juice is sour
It used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder
If you're talking 'bout me

We don't talk the way we used to talk
It's hurtin' so deep
I've got my pride, I will not cry
But it's makin' me weak

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional
Hugs as a token of love from you to me, ooh, baby

I fight my way through the rush hour
Trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner
Will be waiting for you

But when you get there you just tell me
You're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper
And you don't want to talk

You like to think that I'm just crazy
When I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same

You're just going through the motions
And you're not being fair
I've got my pride, I will not cry
Still I can't help but care

I'm not your superwoman (Oh, no, no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional
Hugs as a token of love from you to me

I'm not your superwoman (Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down (Hey)
And think that everything's okay (Don't let me down, don't you let me down)
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human, yeah)
This girl needs more than occasional
Hugs as a token (Ooh, ooh) of love from you to me

Oh, baby, look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times
But I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my love everlasting love if you'll return love to me

I'm not your superwoman (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional
Hugs as a token of love from you to me (Oh, no)

If you feel it in your heart
And you understand me
Stop right where you are
Everybody sing along with me

Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet
But you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me, oh, ho, ho

Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
I need love
I need just your love

I'm not your superwoman (Oh, no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down (You can let down)
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

With tender looks that I mistook for love;
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of.

Your pretty lips look warm and so appealing

They seem to have the sweetness of a rose;
But when you give a kiss there is no feeling

It's just a stiff and artificial pose.

I thought that you would be a perfect lover

You seemed so full of sweetness at the start;
But like a big red rose that's made of paper

There isn't any sweetness in your heart.

Paper Roses
paper Roses

Oh how real those roses seem to be!
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation lover for me.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.005790949,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/yzQ4I/aFHR3XX13r8D/UMD9b5fOi/q3OkrfSIK+j+hXuLTM09SwxuwTx/LR5/I1cX1m5Vl4LFuBAFW2d3Lpa/PGLPnZ/sWlWKP0yFEO6p57ODnv3yO8nazJ/DRoqDqibyeEv7cUzuEJhA1d/Aj6rvwdYbLqg9JpNS/DRh/QX1WuEAaxtlFy1fYLk2+FGwVwlZd6zEg9pPTIzH4jnnWHtKaYWy49ALAextmchD61qV80Z5iD5tA0KgF1406FxlDfjDBrJLwc5hYEHd94hj9/efKJlQI+7UcWQJvRyo+p3pLSfWkbdWOcf+eiCCy/4d9bjkgPY0vamH/r8Gr0zPsFHBve87KSP/ezVlKU+93IOMJjnIjuTJgoVB2XojfkVr3kfQvyO25xyFy5TqjA81yIST+1W+WmSRtf6eTq8Shfkm5M=/,5970315.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/OPtxJ/T2SQaDyjvSjHjqEXGTTbFoCwHIsHAlQLSyWe3eqYTpFnII7JRCbZm/gh7dZOJvESpnUzTND50xeVQ4u8/p8UZ7PVotlbHi/nRJUuyMu1xI+VmXlzTuyVgv1gN8Qs8M2t5B4SugMJpVrLofgq1TM/dZPKMr4dWzalsqrJhmo7yFufkUOpyrjBwPebqa5BcTgfTJR3xf2dv2X9o2hKdpvjZLfWZrwxr2iOBcJkuywcBaXYM4rJ+SSbKsCXLDR+pYFXs1zQnFTY7DO0h/+7e0525Y6sC1Q4hIsWeRx5Qatv4YU+871nKCGk6gE8ORBSvzSTu0VTx9UvL/pTSbZCHfWp7gbHYPqefWi3L8Np+g/ef5Hwjdp0x+vaHg+61W/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:58:14 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/dED7kkBnODqTX/yLEsiM3IOb6mqMvlpRom5HwVW158utleYxn82isu5qnVdhL+FKBfdCzDC1TVR52A007ClN+ZE/JeWPBx0Czoq7QYh3BFKG0kY/W6/spusDZAriokHF44xHYv3dh4VEDpTSu1zmRhToncuwXKZuTGik9IQFSaeuvcW4H23ESaYBGEjJXhu+cANffD0WF141UrLNjRNXE7nkYNKvKnFymOtypMzYiKGRrZgeiyj0L+NR44kJMRrwKCdjz4rCqbt4ZMV27HKJ44IH50FN4HhhUFkHwvGe4soTl5Pl031isGPMeqjRtCcfXMWma1BGa+GDRh34W9zS9mMznKCsgu2xEq/EHsi88+vyY/JS0ob4Wulf5FcbW5pa/,200.0,2010-09-05T15:59:49Z,[],paper roses,1973

Here we are, just the two of us together
Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes
(HIM)
I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no

But I think about you and hope that you're okay
Hopin' you'll call before anyone gets home
I wait anxiously alone by the phone

I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Livin' two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there or fall

CHORUS:
(BOTH)
Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
Tryin' so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let go
'Cause what we feel is, oh, so real
So real, so real

(BOTH)
You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves all of the time

(HIM)
In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
(HER)
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful so that no one will know

Don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away

You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made

She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control

You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes

Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait--you got to
Tell her about it",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009424925,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/FQ8qKBoZ6Kaq+OhlaYEA3sC2Jyh+JBlz7WeQU1gv+tcbQo33+hXHUi5INhgyosu9smmtWaNhcp8OC651Ocaq8QvRDqKvO44dJJ9Yz/67IqE5FtetNT5Lp6A1DF3pLZttHn74KlIsuhrjqTEqqTcWJeyQHjkl65TPGkRTxvfdHjPOpuXmFDpBJK+r3pVJojtBvyVkW9q0sxdiQjTXNb43G2yeTN4ejEm5xZBlhHNJ42xXcRuWFovi2L5hTwlHjhSwa7H8QmV39SNfyfBf5cjoZ6qgRaXkv5mdie30vcKdaQ6yj9+36rIh2qMnklYfIPZl0yhtOrHv4wha8QRWPiW6cWHW/vhTjgKv/aON6y2ts43mhANd0UjxVX2a148ztxLsmHly5GbLSV3sNG3ezGmPhnRHbRYWs1QZ4M7N9ad4XyY=/,1533804.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/jubZpzvpKLe4AkhgEfOR4di/d0DSA+vernmw1NPBV521hm7AwmzlW2imtumD/cbROIRnLGTxC4KageW19Awe2lBqQiwUuQ71qLtF1UqgrU3n++Bgs6Wj/Cfk07d06M2SBNizmOBrKNO5h/miK+7ZViEviUOQ9Hk6L9L6/Tk83FIsgV/j33LQK6vbsIoA2ZIAACTdbP64SCfFpGZWq6SwhDhWAVvragn3/u6e9lNrKv7lszt9RqLNhwGvZhPDsJDjO/PdfCK0UrYHx2r5OZ4MNdCc55RwKPxeBIwkKvvRF4m14Qg7KjsTcSOruxf6567hWrCl5UXkeRbBNrhhCbeCH3P3+fTF83XTD4K+sZrnaNCKcLQzXJlWPgcJqScthlR6VCb4HlRLlM9EKKaT5AwYL67+XNGX1RnkTy2mb0LV0gQ=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:02:11 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/6xRjAZ+qZ4BhgU+0wSOB8S3YvrGx0WlnVUKRnCVv2A6iGZ2YMZ2PsKknessTWuYNYNXXFAvhsDD267HHSqQTQFhEviMMbtk8k3XshKDEtvsudwOpQVRQDdfd05/8ZRg3DAqqyV5QYsVAWTWA/bVWcpJl/6kNOKe1rs68jJoaXHsG3P0ocjHoyDf0Yk8PojU21PxN8+hD++aSmhrIqbhBt2yHCSqdHU6MpFnVUj2Y3ssd2jeFMfGEydQ7MskUP+5XUQnyeguIZZEaobrOkiSmRwo0uWK+S5LE6Hv/SGbcRgbh0U3n6nACiLo0eH9EJH2LbiwKt+cnVy7qWjIycLBXeNfAjv/YUYajMutVpNZpn1qPiSpUcGTAdPIW8qxThuGM4J1dzstfCCXoGiib234G0afYH4ln08CcpIFsOiwzmJI=/,200.0,2011-02-08T20:13:07Z,[],tell her about it,1983

When I think about, all the years we've put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far, then I think about
Where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

I wanna come home to you and only you

I just gotta be with you

Do you think about, us finishing somethin' we started so long ago
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about, maybe us having some babies?

I'm ready to, commit to you

And I love the time we spend

I waited for the break of day to come
So I could see your smile in the sun
I guess I couldn't wait to get to school, oh baby
To see your pretty face, I've got to stay cool

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away
I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide?
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Think of all the great things we would do

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Oh, we were young and sure did have our way

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
Oh, yes, those were the days

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
Oh, yes, those were the days

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid

Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Dope enough to go in yo' nostrils

I take ya girl and kidnap her
Beat her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet
It's probably dead ass rappers

It's probably pussy ass niggas
Don't try me I pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my car
And your rent in my swisha

That pussy so good I miss ya
Head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese
Like I'm taking pictures

My office is my tour bus

She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew wassup
She think I'm the realest out
And I say ""damn, that makes two of us""

Aww that look like what's her name
Chances are it's what's her name
Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again

She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young ass an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm

Go ask them who just catch it
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax
Me an' Chainz go way back
We don't talk shit, we just say facts (Just know it)

Name a nigga that want some
I'll out rap his ass
I'll trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trash ass

Take 'em out, bring 'em in
Them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn't
Went where they say I couldn't (true)

YSL belt buckle
Y'all niggas sure is looking
Y'all niggas sure is lucky
2 Chainz on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel
Right hand on that pussy

There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of
My left side brain
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind.

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad
You have a one track
Mind like me.

You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat
Right out my untrimmed chest

I believe in you.
Like a virgin
You're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you're the only drug I need
You're so gangsta
I'm so thug
You're the only one
I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be
With me

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister

Hold onto, on to your innocence
Stand your ground when everyone's giving in

In a little apartment, just trying to get by
Living on, on dreams and spaghetti-o's
Wondering where your life is gonna go

Who's wished upon a shooting star

Who dream with everything they have

Tossing pennies into The Fountain of Youth

Made you who you are today

Why don't you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?

Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who knew your soul?

I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
I'm the one you used to meet

Around the corner
Everyday
We would meet
And slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?

Am I the same girl?

Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who knew your soul?

I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending you don't care
But the fire is still there
Now we are no longer too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?

Have you ever felt the need for something more
With every week comes scratching at your door
Have you ever stopped and wonder what it is you're searchingfor
Push your luck too far with me
But if you push it any further
You won't have any

he seeks the sheltered nest
like the sailor's lost horizon,
he needs some place to rest
the songs that he's been singin'
no longer make much sense
and those stranger's cold perceptions
they've killed his confidence
nightingale, she sails away upon a sea of song
nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along
when his tired voice is broken
his golden hope is gone
she makes a lost soul's simple longing
somehow not so wrong
nightingale, nightingale

by the thought of his success
those spotlights shadows
how they lured him and took him like all the rest
but that old dream don't look good now
no it don't seem quite the same
he needs to hear a tender word
won't you sing him home again
nightingale, she sails away up on a sea of song
nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along
when his strength is slowly going,
his pride is all but gone
she makes a foolish dreamer listen to one last song

oh, na, na, na, na

in my little town
i grew up believing
god keeps his eye on us all
and he used to lean upon me
as i pledged allegiance to the wall
lord i recall my little town
coming home after school
riding my bike past the gates of the factories
my mom doing the laundry
hanging out shirts in the dirty breeze
and after it rains there's a rainbow
and all of the colors are black
it's not that the colors aren't there
it's just imagination they lack
everything's the same back in my little town
In my little town i never meant nothing
i was just my father's son
saving my money
dreamin of glory
twitching like a finger on a trigger of a gun
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town

My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me.

Can we believe in fairytales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me.

Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me
Don't ask why.
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

(girls)
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, baby.

Don't cry my love
I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me.

I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

Dummies, playboy bunnies, those wantin' money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nothin'
But penetration, unless it smell like sanitation
Garbage; I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Gucci down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi
Girls peep peep when they see me
Navajos creep me in they tepee
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet
Stop it, if you think your gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns; get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya
I'm clockin' ya; Versace shade watchin' ya
Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin
First I talk about how I dresses this
In diamond necklaces, stretch Lexus's
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper, help ya reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
Now sing the break

Baby...
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
All I need is one more chance
(One more chance)
I can help you find yourself
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
You don't need nobody else
(One more chance)

Sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan
Schemin'
Don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real; ask Puff Daddy (yeah)
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke?
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through; can ya sing the song for me, boo?

(One more chance) one more chance
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
Give me one more chance
(One more chance)
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
Biggie, give me one more chance (one more chance)

So, what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crush linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp; I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion, flyin' into all states
Sexin' me while ya man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewind
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president

Baby...
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
All I need is one more chance

I can help you find yourself

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours, a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me

And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with 5-0 it's all startin to make sense
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me

To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago, I was your man, was your man

Verbaly we agreed it was over
And we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you, girl

We can't be friends
(Yeah, no oh)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love with you

(Deb)
I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you're still family
And it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
And I've tried and I can't do it
Cuz I'm still torn

I tried to think of you as just another love
In my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby

We can't be friends
(Oh no, no, no, no)
We can't be friends
(If we, if we can't be lovers)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love

(Both)
You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head
When you come my way
Don't get too close to me
And expect me to behave

(RL ) I might just steal a kiss
(Both) If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say

Repeat 1 while:
(RL ) We can't be friends
(Deb ) Can you look me in the eyes
and honestly say you dont love me?
(RL ) Said do you know
(Deb ) R.L. I know
(Both) I'll never ever find another love like you, oh no
(RL ) I love you too much baby
(Deb ) I love you too much, oh
(Both) We can't be friends, I'm still in love
(Deb ) with you
(RL ) With you
(Deb ) I am

Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own

Oh baby

But since I was trying too hard

I think I'll start to have my own friends.

that you're qualified to fill your needs.
You think you've pulled one over on me

Well honey

My criteria compared to your career just isn‰Ûªt fair
I‰Ûªm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don‰Ûªt write shit cause I ain‰Ûªt got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the al mighty dollar
And the al mighty power of that chit cha cha chopper
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motherfuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge pussy poppin‰Ûª
Tell the coppers‰Û_ hahahaha you can‰Ûªt catch ‰Û÷em, you can‰Ûªt stop ‰Û÷em
I go by them goon rules if you can‰Ûªt beat ‰Û÷em then you pop ‰Û÷em
You can‰Ûªt man ‰Û÷em then you mop ‰Û÷em
You can‰Ûªt stand ‰Û÷em then you drop ‰Û÷em
You pop ‰Û÷em cause we pop ‰Û÷em like Orville Redenbacher

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair
With coke in her derier
Like smoking the thinnest air I open the Lamborghini
Hoping them crackers see me like look at that bastard Weezy
He‰Ûªs a beast, he‰Ûªs a dog, he‰Ûªs a mutherfuking problem
Ok your a goon but what‰Ûªs a goon to a goblin?
Nothing, nothing you ain‰Ûªt scaring nothing
On some faggot bullshit call ‰Û÷em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it‰Ûªs private damn I hate a shy bitch
Don‰Ûªt you hate a shy bitch yeah I hate a shy bitch
She ain‰Ûªt shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch ahaha
Yeah nigga that‰Ûªs my bitch 
so when she ask for the money when you through don‰Ûªt be surprised bitch

And I‰Ûªm ok, but my watch sick
Yeah my drop sick

They say I‰Ûªm rapping like BIG, Jay and 2Pac
Andre 3000 where is Erika Baduh at
Who that?
Who that said they gon‰Ûª beat Lil Wayne
My name ain‰Ûªt Bic but I keep that flame man
Who that one that do that boy ya knew that you done swallow
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels
I don‰Ûªt owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I‰Ûªd rather be pushing flowers
Then to be in the Pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the bible told us every girl was sour
Don‰Ûªt play in her garden and don‰Ûªt smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I‰Ûªm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn‰Ûªt doubt me
Mutherfuker I say life ain‰Ûªt shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the Coupe like it‰Ûªs pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Damn that
Don‰Ûªt you compare me cause there ain‰Ûªt nobody near me
They don‰Ûªt see but they hear me
They don‰Ûªt feel me, but they fear me

Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true, cause
You moved to West L.A or
New York or Santa Fe or
Wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you
Cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed
And frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to yaou
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y
Just a shy guy,
Looking for
A 2-ply hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
Everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to yaou
I'll be there for yaou
This is not a drive by-y-y-y

On the other side to a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again so
Let's skip the ""how you've been"" and
Get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night
Was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed
And frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to yaou
I'll be there for yaou
This is not a drive by-y-y-y
Just a shy guy,
Looking for
A 2-ply hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
Everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true, cause

Oh I swear to yaou
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y
Just a shy guy,
Looking for

Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey

The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?

A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

""Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you""

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

""Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you""

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

""Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck may God bless you""

Is that your little girl
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you""

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)

Or maybe we've just stopped tryin'

Something inside has died and I can't hide it
And I just can't fake it

You were light and breezy
And I knew just what to do

But we just can't stay together don't you feel it too?

And how I once loved you

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be
I'm gonna sit right here and
Tell you all that comes to me
And if you have something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

You ready

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it.
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable
Would it make us look crazy
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready

I know you were sent to me
This is exactly how it should be
When it's meant to be
Time is only wasting so
Why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

Baby, Ooh

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away

Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

But love
I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

Without love
I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you

Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-beleive
People say I sit and try
But whan it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is,
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory, glory hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall,
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve learning to love yourself,
it is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they posses inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believed
No matter what they take from me

I found the greatest love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all

Learning to love yourself,
It is the greatest love of all

That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.037367105,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ijifOhJfuAIepgA4jZgRehNlPO+3hBeudUhPGgMRciF9ebUC7Sbj8gyBCWRt8Uf+r3gqvV4PHaQllRzdT1wpM4xNQMWyyad5y8rFbd0bGBfq+HcB0bw8drYwEvxib5kk18LJhHPCKI8hyVnlKF4GVeiyMWsx3lpadopCq4iCCUQHsgRH8tQEwZNr90MyFxhDIP1yD+yN6kPzZEh0ib7q553gdZnHhJFV7hhtogfVD4itHojQgLiNmb/U+Bu6ImLJ9SQN9Umgb4M/yLbSDKDwgrZBFUwv31SON6zxZtRVBZpne/yWo/rfb1doSauryhgxHGfvLjG1xD598ztlQ9kJAWXoMYNJhMlVCf2ByluwKNmSj4Q/331hwnpHoFvL7u8+Kp23qH4z38q0TniIG4VmagrtMEXPcNBFyoauijIbysI=/,7179107.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/O/buYRuHhiCQzKeyq+paA9/OjrAk0bGsFZHW+SFkrrS/Vl5hBOQPvGWTLZcGxojIcvYJTaLZpLnPftSAD9XfyyIEUAus3QR03ObBS3mfNkdb1qf/HdsGh3JJHTiKIbOxaL0UsP7AVuz016Za4AjlaA6PvwtQFWLFBiU5DQpYwldOQYQk84fpPncrD1zrsA7QhDkR7HeliWJ/DsC/Bc8+0NzGtXwqiq6eNHSWpr1ZG1nlihiauV8CEJm86oA3HD06vBuzfWGo0omyLR+cQpNN8Ob9G2uuGnR7k31QzkGjOTWCM517Qnh8p4N6Iq2Z9WM2tI9xKckZAyZx/UxQYuy3Oqco/8UGpym9rbuIh2VTx2quonQZ2ZaDjEcC84ZU/c9dS/TTKv+KkSnbdnL28XTxFYmRaH6+DpFHaLWL2p3gbHE=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:03:18 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/P8w0eebrVPmTKZZvEJiDZhZw33K6O1cBDrxq7sgPILQHQihgNQ+USKRsixgsL408URZBx4rwVz4JkvL/ioebPwYJKBqBTMmIkcL2eTW0T0VKqGNYMbMXeOsR2RDHC+YPJ5AkP4NXgj9sN2NfBvyUnaVoR/zaxkEJ084tu2JihGFpYLBPkCNOqr0MSdvkKj138HdFDOMaH6toyoPoQOkwzOllPMavXYhkYtJmU0QIjJZsHmKuMVQ16xfHCbnTOYE4xyzgKv9AGUzvUNrVHVkDSg7uqq9MsJRAwiakq5X5EV++yPDDWwzizBuk4ZBEw5wy2908M714Jb18hZBEYL1b9FOBMYDA/Ggo0zalGjpx0WuO4J/w6FkhbnG+0MFZnpMHGtv/yP7rXINetk/Xfazf8/HfNKgp3AZPjkI0l35DNaE=/,200.0,2012-02-13T09:14:50Z,[],greatest love of all,1986

With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when yours are through

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am just missing you again

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17

Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on baby, let's start anew
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

Now I know I know that it's true

Here we go again
Ghettoville U.S.A. (uh Oh)
You know I go by the name Nitti right (uh huh)
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right (who dis nigga mane)
Dis nigga go by the name of joc (joc?)
He resides in collegepark (collegepark cp)
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

Niggaz in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay
Tell 'em collegepark
Where they chop cars
in 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Just bought a zone jays on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough
If a girl chews let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggaz throw the duces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (ok)

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba 2 do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of ben franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I thank they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls likin girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Time to set it off let these nigga know
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail but they don't thank I know
I keep my hands clean cuz I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye
Ask 'em how I know its me, surprise!
Put it in the air rip where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin is a habit let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Yung Joc?!
Nitti strikes again

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face...
I get ""the tinglies"" in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do too but um... I just wanted to know, 
do you know somebody named... you know his name
Oh yeah definitely, I know his name
I just want to let you know that he's mine
Uh, no no, he's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk, face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man
Are you insane

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day
Ain't that a shame

Well maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All of my love was all it took

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true

I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Anyway it's my time to shine
If you didn't know it the boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine, without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
This special places in my heart
Cause he was my love, right from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

He belongs to me (sang in chorus)
The boy is mine, not yours (after chorus)
Not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine

I'm sorry that you

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever, the search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever, the search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle
Our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me
Show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain
The man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes

Watching a new love grow
from old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone

Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me

you're not half as free to wander as you claim.
i'm easy, i'm easy. say the word, i'll play your game,
as though that's how it ought to be. i'm easy.
don't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take me,
if loving you will have to be a sometime thing.
i can't put bars on my insides; my love is something i can't hide
i still hurt when i recall the times i've tried. i'm easy, i'm easy.
take my hand and pull me down.
i won't put up any fight, because i'm easy.
don't do me favors, let me watch you from a distance,
cause when you're near, it's hard for me to keep my head.
when your eyes throw light at mine, it's enough to change my mind
make me leave my cautious ways and world behind.

Itchin' to come outside
Messin' with your conscience
In a way your face can't hide

Oh things are gettin' real funky
Down at the old corral
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'
It's the stinkin' lies you tell

[Bridge]
What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white lie turns into a black one

So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're getting ready to know

It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turned up the heater
An' a it's gettin' ready to pop

Crevices in your pantry
Now what do we have in here
Havin' a day time nightmare
Has always been your biggest fear

Oh things are gettin' real crucial
Up the old wazoo
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?
When the culprit's y-o-u

Somebody done just dropped the big dime
And they're gettin' ready to squeal

I just can't deny it
Everybody knows I can't deny it
Everybody knows
You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune tller
Telling you the very truth

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You bring out the best in me
With love and understanding
Anytime I need some understanding
You are always there

And if I ever lose my way
You're always there to guide me
Anyone can see you're here inside me
Anyone can see it

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

This is our time, we have it all
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall
We'll work it out and get it right
And when I get home to you
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

This is our time, we have it all
When I come home at night
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are GONE

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

SPOKEN
""One more time, everybody, now""

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose

I remember how it used to be
You never was this nice, you can't fool me
Ooh, bop!
Now you're talkin' like you made a change
The more you talk the more things sound the same

What makes you think you can just walk back into her life
Without a good fight?
I just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself
'Cause you're just wasting your time, oh!

Save your breath, you won't get very far
Ooh, bop!

The only thing you changed was love to hate

It doesn't matter what you do or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way

Doesn't matter what you do or what you say
She don't love you, no way
Maybe next time, you'll give your woman a little respect

(Davis/Severinsen)

Hey Mister
Where you going in such a hurry
Don't you think it's time you realized
There's a whole lot more to life than work and worry
The sweetest things in life are free
And there right before your eyes

You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way

Before you went to work this morning in the city
Did you spent some time with your family
Did you kiss your wife and tell her that she's pretty
Did you take your children to your breast and love them tenderly

You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way

Did you ever take a walk through the forest
Stop and dream a while among the trees
Well you can look up through the leaves right straight to heaven
You can almost hear the voice of God
In each any every breeze

You got to Stop and Smell the Roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the Roses along the way

You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road

I found out those bright lights aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams I'm comin' home
But tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe'
He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!
Can you make these big wheels burn?

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I can't blame her for lettin' go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain runnin' down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes!

Run and find the one who loves me

No need to talk it out

Dro, I'm clean in this b****
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this b****
N**** buck, carbon 15 in this b****
This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich

I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist
I ride 26 and let my 9 screens flip
Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, 9 up in a clip

Triple black Phantom n**** nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms diamonds man but nah it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk and I bet my motor clean

Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork an' beans
Everybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me
Dro, h*** scopin' me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon

Red, black and white Chevy now I'm ridin' Deion
Put them lights off in my rims now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like crayon, h*** know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though

First I let my wheels spin then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a foe? Take that chick to Berlin
My chick break triggers after that we say they girlfriend

My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Name it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cockin' hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda
Many think I'm pimpin' in linen and salamander sandals

Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta, show killers with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET, out the channel
Hood playa from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana

I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin'? Shawty, I ride glazed on the Haze
Gator green Chevy, gator guts, alligator J's

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean

Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say
She needs me?
I know she's not
As strong as she seems

Why don't I see
Her cry for help?
Why don't I feel
Her cry for help?
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste

Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do
Is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
I will be there
When you cry for help
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do
Is cry for help

All that I need
Is to cry for help
I will be there
When you cry for help
Is it so hard to cry for help?

Cry for help is all I need
No need to feel ashamed

And the first time you touched me, I felt love.
And after
all this time, you're still the one I love.)
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""

And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind
'Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're makin'
Then I don't know what it is

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind
'Cause it seems so hard to believe

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind

Uh, I don't know it's, it's just a thing with me you know
If I see somethin' that I like, it's a, I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby, ah, come here

I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company
That's right

Jerk out, jerkin' everything in sight
And you know that I'm talkin' about the
Jerk out, I got the cash, I got the ride, oh, Lord
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, ""How much money you make?""
Let's just say it'll be more money
Than you'll ever see in your lifetime

I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell
I figured that was what she liked

I said, ""Baby, don't get too comfortable
'Cuz I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank
I love you, but you got to go""
""What?""

Jerk out, ""You ain't got to go home
But you got to get the hell outta here""
Jerkin' everything in sight, I'm talkin' about the

Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them alone, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.
Every man wants a woman,
That ain't good for just laying on her back.
And I'm that kind of woman
So before me and my man get in the sack

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.

Kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.

But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show
My feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend ev'ry moment with you
I guess you should know
I love you so

(Chorus 1:)
You are my lady
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

There's no way that I can resist
Your precious kiss
Girl, you've got me
So hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me
'Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you
More each day

(Chorus 2:)
You are my lady, my love
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

There can only be brighter days
'Cause I didn't mean that much to you
Work it out, don't lose the fight
You can make it turn out right
'Cause you've got the heart to be secure

When I wanted you I needed you
And I still can't bring myself to say I'm over you
When I gave you time to make up your mind
You turned you back on me
And now I've got to turn my back on you

After all that we've been through
Leavin' you is so hard to do
But when I close my eyes I don't feel the pain
What was wrong and who was right
In the end you see the light
'Cause you think a lot when you're on your own

When I wanted you
I needed you
And I still can't bring myself to say I'm over you
When I gave you time to make up your mind
You turned you back on me
And now I'm turnin' mine on you

Now you're on your own
How does it feel
To feel the way I used to feel

i think of a resting place
a place where theres peace, quiet, and serenity
and thats where some of my friends have gone
friends who have traveled with me through my wonderful experience in oz
a journey ill never forget
When i think of home, i think of a place
wheres theres love overflowing
i wish i was home, i wish i was back there
with the things ive been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
suddenly the raindrops that fall they have a meaning
sprinklin the scene
makes it all clean
(when i think of home)
maybe theres a chance for me to go back
now that i have some direction
(maybe theres a chance ill get home)
it sure would be nice to be back at home
where theres love and affection
And just maybe i can convince time to slow up
givin me enough time, ooh, in my life to grow up
time be my friend
and let me start again
Suddenly my worlds gone and change its fate
and i still know where im going
i have had my mind spun round in space
and watched it growing
And oh, if youre listening, god, please dont make it hard
to know if we should believe the things that we see
tell us should we try and stay or should we run away (should we run away)
or will it be better just to let things, let them be, oh
Livin here in this brand new world
might be a fantasy
but its taught me to love, oh, yeah
and its real, its so real, its real to me
And ive learned that we must look
inside our hearts to find
a world full of love
like yours, like mine
Like home
like, like home

givin me their energy, oh

never, ever be taken away from me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again, just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine

When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry just like before
It's yesterday once more

[(Shoo be do lang lang)(Shoo be do lang lang)]

Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
[(Oldie, oldies but goodies)]
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine

All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry just like before
It's yesterday once more

[(Shoo be do lang lang)(Shoo be do lang lang)]

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines

Nothing seems to go my way
You lift me up and give me courage
To face this world another day

I get excited when I see you
Shiver when I look in your eyes
I'm glad I found you and I won't let go
And be forever by your side

You are my everything
You are my everything

When I need a friend to talk to
You tell me what I need to hear
And when I need someone to hold me tight
I turn to look and you appear

No one else can do the things you do
And ask for nothing in return
Now let me show how much I care for you
Giving you all the love that you deserve, 'cause you are

You are my everything
You are my everything

You are the one in my life
And I want you to stay
In my heart you comfort me
That's why I can truly say that you are

When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody oo Somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
Dontcha wanna dance with me boy
Hey Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don'tcha wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don'tcha wanna dance

Join voices in protest
To social injustice
A generation full of courage
Come forth with me

People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation

This is the test
No struggle no progress
Lend a hand to help
Your brother do his best

Things are getting worse
We have to make them better
It's time to give a damn
Let's work together, come on now

People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation

Rhythm nation
(Sing it people, say it different)
(Sing it if you want a better way of life)

Rhythm nation
(Sing it people, say it different)
(Sing it if you want a better way of life)

Everybody sing
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation

We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world, today

Got a weird thing to show you,
So tell all the boys and girls.
Tell your brother, your sister
And mama too, cause they‰Ûªre
About to go down
And you‰Ûªll know just what to do.

Wave your hands in the air
Like you don‰Ûªt care, glide by
The People as they start to look and stare.
Do you dance, do your dance quick
Mama, come on baby, tell me what‰Ûªs
The Word, ah ‰ÛÒ word up,
Everybody say when you hear the call
You got to get it underway,
Word up, it‰Ûªs the code word,
No matter where you say it,
You‰Ûªll know that you‰Ûªll be heard.

Now all you sucker. D.J.‰Ûªs
Who think you‰Ûªre fly
There‰Ûªs got to be a reason
And we know the reason why.
And act real cool
But you got to realise
That you‰Ûªre acting like fools.
If there‰Ûªs music we can use it
We need to dance.
We don‰Ûªt have that time
For psychological romance
No romance
No romance
No romance for me mama
Come on baby tell me what‰Ûªs the word.

Yet I look for the light
Through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feeling the strain
Ain't it a shame

I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wasting time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
Now I'm counting on you
To carry me through

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitar's coming through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you're given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Your rythm and rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along
Makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll

Just the lonely beating of my heart

No use in holding other hands
For I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking just of your caress

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again.

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009277105,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/K/OwhxeQBDFISZDUtPEsb06y2ipfCyxxeEyB4hhiDk+hHXrIl7Al8Ke0A3zeexZdIH+8Fyr96IJUo8y1uCWe9h4nYFLZpR8U0jqo3eh90EsCcZQYPp3T4yZTAL+KL7hs6F7yyK9LNSs8F6OI6fmBuF39FO245t5q+BrNn7sF2GkpK604D5cIVxUGZnNC/G+OOremyoBtGSpt8+WyFdYds7pMca4qkujw8kZXBreqygbuOLhY7AjxDZobGQfAk2sdc/g1qEngZayhM3TlIloZstOQ3nFEj1Co6a+S+46ZuWopDAHPYHn08wzKgNlAHfiw732IaP/zGfv4kZb1hOgQKSJPagtRRETXXTyZCJr8Cs5rTTwTVpWu/qWVxeo/OD6VOr/IxY82MrBrB6rB67BHrNI4zvvmmtY9eB9ZQpXGvxI=/,1285723.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/oZdHscRo67CMbODItzAJrSyPdycmdfrgmNQlDxeHUMRpma7Ells8CNrG1o4uWqQyW/Xou2zreF4glyI4yvz3yl83swnfzcuDsXikb60iHE1Q75G3MkPzRAqvX4uOKmjTWJqXvdtJXtWfadVAhIJMpOZqP3d4Rf0d5vsPrUaqBHo2pr7Yqta62wL5uohkyz+5aMSdlYp36ZQcvTu2m7Dv0qhDYJiVBBpE+UA8CObKVb/y6p71h4a19MgasB8vofWKQmBwK9sN8qloNDhuF0qhlG4QeYvm6GeJ5GyOBb6BdOPSjGI1IW7qMzMsidRjm5iTKCd3sy1mh3I9BJi/i0tnd1eXP+5Uzndtg7Bs8mNj9MCaW6vlZxvZ9ezMIM8siyZm/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:51:56 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Uic/UUgPzskpnmFjSNlWWR8DaLKDKe0/lorXG+MpXk04UHhCoa/JO0xb2lZH2uZhFqM2nykXx6WuwdvKXZp8ZbTgx/znHdPg7M3Qf7UyI/IlEXXy6UCo8SthZceDvtkOJA4ObpxRhVKp74sqzNWqrI0K9sOjAaOF+hyzpzFLsWF9P869KevceLNxxxe9F1KYq+tI+YUOnjZdHre1v8YFaK+jy0EZW+YQHh3Kiqr3Ntc7EvfKkGlBnY1NfXsMg+JdBl8p9axvNSfAXyPc4iQAIcXEOGK3/MlfHI/+vkKfKMZ+5nWa6jQoOUqW/ozYl+72kfWpWJirCQoPiVgscg+RPmBi1c0j6P9i6iC/8KsEq9+S4L6OxIT3T98FbwU2Lixw/,200.0,2010-06-29T03:41:21Z,[],all alone am i,1962

Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right

Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thurr wit me, bottle poppin', livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like

We didn't have a worry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Say what? Baby, I'ma superstar and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on your side, you betta run wit it

Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and hurr, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me

'Cuz when I'm outta town, always think of hurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but no one come above hurr
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like damn

So that means we gotta make it work

Walk in the house wit hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner wit some dessert? Uh uh
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clownin'

Before we end up fightin', let me leave
I'm exhausted and this here, I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellaz, ridin' and drinkin'
She blowin' my two-way up but I need some time for thinkin'

Yeah, I wanna go back, but sumthin' sayin' naw
Lemme give her some space and the next day, I might call
What should I do? Look, lemme ask y'all
Should I stand tall or let this relationship fall?

I ain't down wit havin' my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes, either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like damn

So that means we gotta make it work

To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times led to bad times and you ain't see it comin'
Tried your best to make her happy but it wasn't enough
'Cuz Mama told me in relationships, the road get rough

And I ain't the one to have my head down, weepin', stressed out
As bad as it hurts, I gotta move to the next route, yes
I thought I was her man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like damn

Chorus:

Let the time flow
Let the love grow
Let the rain shower
Let the rose flower
Love it seeks and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds

We come to each other from different worlds
Drawn to each other by the love inside of us
We give to each other our different worlds
Long as we can do it
Life is gonna breeze right through it

(Chorus)

We reach for each other from different worlds
With love for each other that will stand the test of time
We're up to the challenge of different worlds
With this love inside us
There is nothing can divide us

(Chorus)

Love it seeks and love it finds
(Love it seeks and love it finds)
Love it conquers, love it binds

Love it seeks and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds

We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Sometimes I see you and you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire and holding on we find

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Round off the edges
Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

That's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for

Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more

Holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin'
to give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love
Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleepin'
But every mornin'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh, sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Every night and day,
You get the best of my love(the best of my love)
Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love.

They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture, it's just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Oh yeah

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define, oh no
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh, when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love gonna keep on growin', just keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing, oh yeah
I'll say it again and again

And turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing

They're tearing it down now
But it's just as well
I haven't shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby
I've got plans for you

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
And now I need the rest of you

Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back
And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
I know we've got to move somehow
But I don't want to lose you know

Sometimes it's so easy
To let a day
Slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will i
And those will be the days you can never recall

And so we embrace again
Behind the dunes
This beach is cold
On winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
But we won't
Although we'll want to

(Jermaine Dupri and Aaliyah)
Hmmm, whoa, whoa, yeah
(I gotcha back)
Oh hey
(I gotcha back)

Verse 1:
I bet women always wonder how I keep my man
They've been trying for so long
And still don't understand
It's not the things I say it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, no where to go
And on top of that, I let 'em know

Chorus:
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You'll never have to worry about a thing
I gotcha' back (I got your back)
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody gots your back
(I gotcha back)

Verse 2:
I am the type when I find a man I like
It's on and popping, ain't no stopping
The things I do for you
No complications baby, keep it real
Do unto me as I do and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Lean on me when you're not strong, I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on

Chorus:
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You'll never have to worry about a thing
I gotcha' back (I got your back)
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good

A little attitude problem all good, it‰Ûªll make the shit last
Don‰Ûªt make it too easy, girl, don‰Ûªt take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Runnin on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowin you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you‰Ûªll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it‰Ûªs just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don‰Ûªt love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can‰Ûªt you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It‰Ûªs just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I‰Ûªm so proud of you

Everything‰Ûªs adding up, you‰Ûªve been through hell and back
That's why you‰Ûªre bad as fuck and you‰Û_

B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I‰Ûªm badder than
Mansions in Malibu: Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I‰Ûªm straddling
And my shit‰Ûªs so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It‰Ûªs Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I‰Ûªm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It‰Ûªs MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I‰Ûªm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I‰Ûªm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just Hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I‰Ûªll give it all away, don‰Ûªt care what the people say
I‰Ûªll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag‰Ûª
I‰Ûªm a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I‰Ûªm guarding?
Double D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can‰Ûªt you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It‰Ûªs just amazing, girl, all I can say is

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me

Playing games
Different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive

We forget, time and place
Hold me now, don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know

The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you, no, no, no, no, no

Here we are all alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this

I want to stop the time from passing by
I wanna close my eye sand feel your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you

There's nothing I can do I'm helpless in your arms
Oh baby what you do I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time no no no

Here we are once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world sometimes lies
Become the game, when loves the prize

And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you is something I should hide
When I have you close to me the feelings so sublime
But there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you no no no

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'

The car I'm driving
I bought it

Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollars

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent
Question: How'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is a front
If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want

Wazzup?
You in the house?
Sure 'nuff
We'll break these people off Angel style

Independent beauty
No one else takes care of me

Whoa

Leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna have you near me

Stop, I love you, stop, stop

On your mind
But how can I ever love you

Could make almost any guy
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's alone at home

Awaiting the day, that you're coming to stay

Had to be the best to reach the top

Can't you stay forever?

2624,dan fogelberg,1411624140,http://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1982/adult-contemporary,2/6/82,adult_contemp,"An only child alone and wild 
A cabinet maker's son 
His hands were meant 
For different work 
And his heart was known to none 

He left his home and went his lone 
And solitary way 
And he gave to me a gift I know
I never can repay 

A quiet man of music 
Denied a simpler fate 
He tried to be a soldier once 
But his music wouldn't wait 
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand 
His gentle means of sculpting souls 
Took me years to understand 

The leader of the band is tired 
And his eyes are growing old 
But his blood runs through my instrument 
And his song is in my soul 
My life has been a poor attempt 
To imitate the man 
I'm just a living legacy 
To the leader of the band 

My brothers' lives were different 
For they heard another call 
One went to Chicago 
And the other to St. Paul 
And I'm in Colorado 
When I'm not in some hotel 
Living out this life I've chose 
And come to know so well 

I thank you for the music 
And your stories of the road 
I thank you for the freedom 
When it came my time to go 
I thank you for the kindness 
And the times when you got tough 
And, papa, I don't think I said
'I love you' near enough 

The leader of the band is tired 
And his eyes are growing old 
But his blood runs through my instrument 
And his song is in my soul 
My life has been a poor attempt 
To imitate the man 
I'm just a living legacy 
To the leader of the band 
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band

I got razors a rippin' and tearin' and strippin' my heart apart as well
Tonight, you told me that you ache for something new
And some other woman is lookin' like something that might be good for you

[CHORUS]

Go on and hold her 'till the scheming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone,
I'm the only one

Please, baby, can't you see I'm trying to explain
I've been here before, and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow that holds you down today

We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.
City lights and business nights.
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance.
No place to be ending but somewhere to start.

No need to ask.
He's a smooth operator,
smooth operator,
smooth operator,
smooth operator.

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.

Face to face, each classic case.
We shadow box and double cross,
Yet need the chase.

A license to love, insurance to hold.
Melts all your memories and change into gold.
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.

No need to ask.
He's a smooth operator,
smooth operator,
smooth operator,
smooth operator.

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.

They send you to Charlie - Baker - Denver row

Cause fuck you and that shit ya stressin
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighbourhood hooker (Slut!)
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead

Sprung, niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
Cause women like you gets no respect

Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I don't really mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
'Cause I don't want to cry all alone

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

(Hey, won't you play)
Won't you play
Another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world

Feels good, everybody
Tender lover, tender love

Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go

Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

Don't ever give up
In spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

My tender lover

Tender lover, tender love
Tender lover, tender love

If you believe in love

Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give

But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love

Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice
Oh oh, girl as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh don't be cruel

Hey yo' Kimmy what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks girl that ain't right

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied
Oh oh, girl as long as I've been givin' my heart to you

Uh no, oh

We used to hang out tough just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find

Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
But due to fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see

But you had to start givin', tryin' to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willin'
To be with me Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete

Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh

But a true love affair we could never find
Don't be, don't be, don't be, don't be
I don't feel good

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everythin'
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too

I like be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm real troop trooper and with all the times
That you were by my side diggin' dollars outta crock

Oh oh, girl as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool, it just ain't cool

You know I got it if you wanna come get it

Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay

Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you were shakin' it for some paper
Took your momma nine months to make ya
Might as well shake what your momma gave ya

You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you'd look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you'se a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind

I got J.O. up on my right side, po'n some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin' a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were sayin' today

But don't forget about this feelin' that I'm makin' you get
And all the calories you burn from me makin' you sweat
The 'Mile High' points you earn when we takin' my jet
And how everywhere you turn, I'll be makin' you wet
'Cause you can

Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay

Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and
Switch it 'til you runnin' right out of breath and
Take a break until you ready again and
You can invite over as many friends

As you want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to
Hey, Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of yo' frame

And I just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic, givin' your body just what it deserves
And let me give you some swimmin' lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breast stroke, stroke of a genius

Yup, call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder than a cinder block, man
Hey, I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meanin' to tell ya
That I really must thank ya when ya

Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it if you wanna come get it

Release Therapy, rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock, rock, rock it and make it work, girl
Please don't stop it until it hurt, girl
You, you been lookin' a little tipsy
So if you could, just shake it a little this way

See, I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distractin' the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like, ""Oh, my God, she could

Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya

Poison you ready Ron I'm ready
You ready Dave I'm ready Slick are you
Oh yeah break it down

Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
Yeah yo situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
Mm mm tell 'em Rick it's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
Yeah mm mm it's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart
Mm mm check it out

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her, wrong move you're dead

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison poison

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I start to leave fly girl
You know 'cause in some portions
You'll think she's the best thing in the world
She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' dreamin'

Poison deadly moving it slow
Looking for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Getting paid laid so better lay low

Schemin' on hots my end the pro show
The low pro hot should be cut like an afro
See what you're sayin' huh
She's weighin' but I know she's a loser
How do you know me and the crew used to do her
Poison (x20)

I was at the bar shake shakin' takin' 'em off
And that night I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas the highs the lows
Keepin' one eye open still clockin' 'em
Still one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be how how is she
Michael me and see and I'm runnin' the show
Bell Biv DeVoe ha-ha ha-ha
Now you know you're Slick blow

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her, wrong move you're dead

That girl is poison (Poison poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile
Poison (Poison poison)
She's dangerous
Poison
Oh yeah (poison) oh yeah

Hear fellas you hear what I'm saying Mike
Yeah baby dance for a fact
What's happened to Ral-T and Johnny G and Bobby Brown
You know who we mean crew

Love is something you should never hide

Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon lies heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding
On his prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
Like a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That keeps him warm

Chorus

Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him
How you've spent your time
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
And you felt the baby move just yesterday

(Repeat chorus then)
(Bridge)

And all the time that I can lay this tired old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing i know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
And it's the light in your eyes that makes me warm

How it stuck to the tires after the summer rain

Oh, how I wish we were back on the road again

Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

I can still recall the wheat fields of St. Paul
And the mornin' we got caught robbin' from an old hen
Old Mac Donald made us work, but then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

I'll never forget that day we motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settlin' down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so, that old car's buggin' us to go
You gotta get away and get back on the road again

Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true and oh baby, I thought that your love was true
I thought you were the answer to the questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel

Now, I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through
The summer time, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
 (Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I'll never know
 (Someone to set my heart free)
How it feels to have a real love 'cause it seems it's not around
 (Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love)
Gotta end it in this way because it seems he can't be found

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free

Toss me and turn me then disappear
Here on the edge of obsession, I turn off all the lights
And pray that this fantasy can be real

Night and day I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through

She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind

I, I can almost taste her and smell the scent of her perfume
I wish she were here for me to lay next to
She's so very close, but like every illusion that's just how it appears
And you reach out to touch and find there's no one there

Right now I'm gonna close my eyes
And go back to where I need to be
Maybe then I'll get to hear her say
That she loves me and she'll never leave

She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind

And caress her like a man should do

Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right

Hey, she's on the left, she's on the right, she's on the middle of my mind
Oh, she's on the left, she's on the right

How do we make love stay?
Now that we know
The fire can burn bright or merely smolder
How do we keep it from dying away?

Elusive as dreams
Barely remembered in the morning
Love like a phantom flies
But held in the heart
It pales like the empty smile adorning
A statue with sightless eyes.

Moments fleet, taste sweet within the rapture
When precious flesh is greedily consumed
But mystery's a thing not easily captured
And once deceased not easily exhumed.

Now that we love

but now it's Kay

Girl
you seem to change it every day.
Your hair was long
but now it's short

You say: I got it cut
but I don't see no hair upon the floor.
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new.

You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it

Know how I know
'cause I can feel it.

You're a fake
baby
no rhyme or reason

'Cause in your mind it's lyin' season.

You had brown eyes
but now they're blue

Those false eyelashes that you're wearin'
too.
In bed this morning you called me CIyde

Alex is the name that I go by!
If women could be counterfit
then you'd be it.

You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it
. . .
You're a fake
baby
I've blown your cover

the iig is up
'cause I discovered -
You're a fake
baby
no need to hide it

Can't change my mind
'cause I've decided -
You're a fake
baby
and I'm disgusted

The game is through and
girl
you're busted
fake!

Whenever I go out with you I find out something new.
You're a fake
you always have a good excuse

But
girl
that ain't no use.
You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it
. . .
You're a fake

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers

I can't, get to work on time,
Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue 'n' fight
Like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the mornin)
I know it's gonna be some more shit tonight
Our pastor's callin', tellin' me
I done went too far in
I'm seen around town
And my friends can't recognize me,
'Cuz I took a chance on love (love),
It's like (like),
I'm dyin' (Ooh dyin')

For you I gave my heart
And turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama,
I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man
That I never thought I'd be.

I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take
But you leave me no options girl
I can't deny how much I love you,
I done gave up errthing I had to
As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say

But you leave me no options girl

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers

I'm losin my mind,
Cant figure out who's wrong or right
I know it's you I love
But then I also know it's you I don't like
You claim you hate who I was
But that's the reason you here now
You think I don't know what's up
But sweetheart that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs
But the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles poppin'
And everything is sweet
But I I'm tired of sleeping in the other room
Spending them long nights
Trying to figure out what in the hell
In my heart I ain't do right. (Ooh for you)

For you I gave my heart
And turned my back against the world (back against the world)
'Cause you were my girl, girl (girl), girl,

Got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

Where you're breaking my heart

How was I to know you'd break

You'd break my heart

An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances,
one too many dances down the narrow street of time.
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining.
Please, don't let that magic ever end.
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
no day so wrong that you can't find your way;
call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.
That day the long and dusty road had us both crying,
we used up our last joke just to try to smile a again.
And only now I find I know what we were learning,
though it's dark and you have traveled far.
Ev'ry long night gives you one bright shining star.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
no day so wrong that you can't find your way;
call on me like you used to do,
I can still show you who you are.
Deep in the night you know that you'll find,
deep in the night you know that you'll find the way.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
no day so wrong that you can't find your way;
call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.

- Suffolk Marketing-SMI 2
- NOT to be confused with the Fats Domino-written ""Bo Weevil"" that was charted
in 1956 at # 17 by Teresa Brewer and # # 35 by Domino
- Words and Music by Brook Benton and Clyde Otis

Transcriber's note: all words are spoken EXCEPT those in

which are sung.

Let me tell ya a story about a boll weevil
Now, some of you may not know, but a boll weevil is an insect. And he's found
mostly where cotton grows. Now, where he comes from, hm, nobody really knows.
But this is the way the story goes.

The farmer said to the boll weevil ""I see you're on the square"" Boll weevil said to the
farmer ""Say yep! My whole darn family's here""

The farmer said to the boll weevil ""Say, why do you pick my farm?"" The weevil just
laughed at the farmer 'n' said ""We ain't gonna do ya much harm""

ho-o-o-o-o,-o-o-o, -o-o-o, o-o-ome""

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug. He said ""Hey, I'd like to make a trade with
you. But, ya see if I was a lightning bug, I'd search the whole night through""

SEARCHIN' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home""

And the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said ""Ya better sell your old machines,
'cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh, you can't even buy gasoline."" I'M gonna
stake me a home, gotta have a home

And the boll weevil said to the farmer, said "" Farmer, I'd like to wish you well.""
Farmer said to the boll weevil, ""Yeah, an' I wish that you were in ****""
LOOKIN' for a
home, lookin' for a home (Ahh, you have a home all right, you have a home (A real hot
home, ahhh

I want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I want to know
If what you feel is real

Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say
And, oh, I want to love you, girl
In a special way
Come here, woman

We've been together
For so very long
I'd hate to break up
Break up our happy home

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try

I'll be good to you

Girl, we've been
Together so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up my happy home

Take a stand now
And let me know how
All of your ways, baby, baby
And all your know hows

Makes me feel that it's worth a try

You know what I mean, baby

American Express
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week

Oh, oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love

And you can have your drive-in - picture show

Biding my time watching Scotty grow

Making a castle out of building blocks
And a cardboard box, that's my boy
Micky Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock
Well that's quite a shock, but that's my boy
In four short years I've gone from rags to riches
And what I did before that, I don't know
So let it rain on my windowpane
I got my own rainbow
And we're sitting here shining,
watching Scotty grow

Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed
Old sleepyhead, that's my boy
Gotta have a drink of water and a story read
A teddybear named Fred, that's my boy
What's that you say momma, come on and keep your feet warm?
Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so

caught up in your smile

I‰Ûªve never opened up to anyone

when I‰Ûªm holding you in my arms
we don‰Ûªt need to rush this
let‰Ûªs just take this slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and I don‰Ûªt want to mess this thing up
i don‰Ûªt want to push too far

just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one i‰Ûªve been waiting for my whole life
so baby I‰Ûªm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
it will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
it‰Ûªs never felt so real, no it‰Ûªs never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and i don‰Ûªt want to mess this thing up
I don‰Ûªt want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one i‰Ûªve been waiting for my whole life
so baby I‰Ûªm alright, with just a kiss goodnight
no I don‰Ûªt want to say goodnight
I know it‰Ûªs time to leave, but you‰Ûªll be in my dreams

Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Cos love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
Cos you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when its burning low

Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
And I just cast my fate to the wind.

I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is my best friend
And I just cast my fate to the wind

That time has a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears
Alone, alone, alone

There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men like me
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away

That time has a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears
Alone, alone, alone

So now I'm old, I'm wise, I'm smart
I'm just a man with half a heart
I wonder how it might have been

Twist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink
pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underroos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
do something to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (ehehehe)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
(Take that, take that, take that, haha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggaz frontin ain't sayin nuttin (nope)
So I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece (thank you God), with my peeps
Packin, askin who want it, you got it nigga flaunt it

Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi (haaaaah!)
Now who's the real dookie, meanin who's really the shit
Them niggaz ride dicks, Frank White push the sticks
on the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass
Gon' blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras, menage-a-trois, sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plantiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shhh)
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)
Richer than Richie, till you niggaz come and get me

Wreck it buy a new one
Your crew run run run, your crew run run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga wit
flows girls say he's sweet like licorice
So get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (that's right!)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin
for certain, Poppa freakin, not speakin
Leave that ass leakin, like rapper demo
Tell them hoe, take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em wit the force like Obi, dick black like Toby (Obi, Toby)
Watch me roam like Gobe, lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe show me, homey. (say what, homie?)

I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain

So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me

I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Like the stormy nights you wrote a 'Dear Ja' letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather

Bitch, you know better, we live M O B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I N C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy

I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm, feelin' like ya livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home
Sometimes baby, but you're always, on time
Checkin' for one time

You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way
You freak me baby I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious

And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfuckin' hits",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.007508039,1.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ccysl0w1BW2ETxU1EG/H2xG6KeiEhiR5mqhv4S/UQk1T8rK7OKvJ+EDoNc9opIi5t7H5eTaY7InX6GjH3WA0EN71s42A6jaI2xOOxZ3ZXLTxvxC80chEr8U4myY4/JBIvPCD+v9qeAlqC4t9cWvLvHHc37jP1gbETS+rSLHj5Wh9GBV8nk6ZvCqsa9avIA4qqoIlFTOITPo9KRzZQuWe0fdVmL8YtSlobGjHq369D2LDFyJsdB55cB/xAL7b70ayk6nf96yfVrTxgOHA0HSLHweqHMpa20xmGD483/JFfBv73yq0CaIU26cmE8jsQ6HV8PCE/4CvfevMEsXkhaG7P+QNmbR5nQejMxMcrenbB831WSooOCDy1bLiZN2+yCxp/,6203277.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/dtYdKZBjCK9qS6ROaapyKoarQkriyvYyCcfPrYHwZPrrfMt83PD2QgLV4eHUHSD7yAv2LM3iz9kli/EhvvL2k74FW6ZWfUfh90SjY9dYeeWr5Yl1n6LVZc8Ixz2RyxKc8N8u+fkx9CNmQtc/p+0glYzLVczluhyCDPN9jSMKjnj55wBn1bftJpAKUDm8yUcovE8c/VVaVKac9Rw77rqwDCTsF750cK5wIcuoCKOBBcLKtEG3kRgHJA/X40IaKl2vdeXYn8Ot2cLxGJFhzGW4b2u529YOR1+Sr3VbC6nAx/qIHkDxEAWu+5QNFECniyF6+qUPVE1QM+kLe8AvPgCVV1xKgRdbRCqoWBjGAQegKKrBsQwPD8RbMvvtDdLIdQX+/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:39:26 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/q4nvmrIvdicSp9o0FiLog2Jkqul547hXOQl6t1woQw5T8rK7OKvJ+EDoNc9opIi5t7H5eTaY7InX6GjH3WA0EN71s42A6jaI2xOOxZ3ZXLTxvxC80chEr8U4myY4/JBIvPCD+v9qeAlqC4t9cWvLvHHc37jP1gbETS+rSLHj5Wh9GBV8nk6ZvCqsa9avIA4qqoIlFTOITPo9KRzZQuWe0Ut1pK5jsMBpo3D/FdGg02y8KF+A5H8pl47oPZtlx5z4yJHSUg+rHbxQdnzLygct3Mykp1wtyjMGu876s0NQe/Ef4ArRt/eGWw8D7ePhX/hn8BabUD0200HSrUtJ+FjZLHGg0mlE3U6a22wULjpuoh78WCeHxasHp9ZVxSgRLoaw/,200.0,2011-04-01T15:30:51Z,[],always on time,2002

Before anything came between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run to when me and my
Girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I come home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you and how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

Now what's bad, is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do, should I
Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go
And if she may not understand it why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna
You make me wanna

Come along with

Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu

I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Oh my
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red

but this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg...

(Fabolous)
Desert storm yeah, Fabolous yeah. Tweet yeah.
Shorty I strictly wanna spank you. The most I gotta do
Is spell my name to get your vicki's to your ankles.
I'm seriously mami, you're fuckin' with the Kid
aka William H. Bonnie
You know I'm the type that be crushin and merkin'
Having ladies touchin' the hurkin, blushin' and smirkin',
Early in the morning rushin from workin'
Screamin ""Oh my. F-A B-O L-O U-S""
Each night I'm freakin, ma' you aint gonna talk me to death,
Cuz you got free nights and weekends
Ghetto Fabs all over the place...
Oops, there goes my kids all over your face...
Oh my!

(Missy)
(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Umm comin' outta my shirt and then the skirt came down

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head

OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg

And you been leavin' those love letters on my car (everyday)

That you've got to take your spare time to chase after me

To please their guy

Can you please remind me?

The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain't even spose to be here,
Ball so hard, Since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars that's losing time, Hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Bitch behave, Just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets to BK

Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit crazy She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
That shit crazy, Ain't it Jay?
What she order, fish filet
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Act like you'll ever be around muhfuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck ol girl she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin)
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate &a Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone These other niggaas is lyin
Actin' like the summer ain't mine

I got that hot bitch in my home

You know how many hot bitches I own
Don't let me in my zone The stars is in the building

Having a good time with all your good time friends

You're on your own now and I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
As long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (won't go away)
Don't need a smile on me
Looks like it's here to stay
I know that I oughta find someone new

But all I find is myself always thinking of you

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
As long as the rivers run to the sea

It's not the lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this I need your touch You're the only one I'll ever love ohh

To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America

Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up?
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed, goin' on four long years
Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears

Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now, I'm just missing you

How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know, I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

And if I make it out, this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' this real shit off like a gun
I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass players get a real player hatin 'em
'Honey Love' goes platinum and y'all ass come round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
And how I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church
Say, the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world, I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you
And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Alright
OK, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Fittin' to raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh

Put my face up in your neck and breathe (aww, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, It's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three
She like, ""how long I been 'sleep?""
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me

Thanks, for letting me bless ya
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven

And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window

Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me

Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes? til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean

Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

Are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words but
Seasons change

It feels
Like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
But time just runs away (time runs away)
No more day by day
You dream again and scenes remain
But seasons change

(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
Don't you know I need you baby

Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change)
People change
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today

Forever
Seems so far away
There's time for love and for play
You dream about today (about today)
Feelings slips away
The winds that blow they go away
and seasons change

(I want you)
Don't hide your feelings from inside

I got to have your love now baby

I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me

Here's a little lesson Lil Kim don't stress em
Kick em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke up wit my Ex he wit her for now but
Little do she know she just a rebound
Callin my phone she so outta pocket
I been there before o'girl you need to stop it
Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture
My pictures in his wallet
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam now he wanna come home
But I
Don't trust him
Though I still love him
No longer want him
Lookin at his cousin
Kinda buzzin
Loose off the goose
Got him on a chase like cranberry juice
When he's wit you he's wishin it was me
You might be where he's at but I'm where
He wanna be (Baby Baby!)

Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go
Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go

If he ain't gonna treat you

When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more

You excite me now more than you ever did before
What i kept inside is a passion i can't contain anymore

I won't ask you to make me any promises
That i know in my heart you can't keep
All that i ask is that you give me tonight

Only you can satisfy me
Baby say that you won't deny me
Let's make tonight our very special one
And now that we start this fire
We are slaves to our desire
We can't stop when we began
No no no no oh

Hand in hand you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
The time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love

The world is always changing
Nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in
Remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

My baby's drama mama's mama, don't like me
She doing things like havin' her boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio tryin' to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't no one to lay down
She wanna rip you up start a custody war, my lawyer stay down
She never had a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts, on my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and yo daughter
Got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this
Feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, and if I'm lyin' find
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love theme, together dream
Bout that crib with the goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever never seems that long until your grown
And notice that the day by day rule can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (OOOH)

Never meant to make your daughter cry

Uh, uh, yeah ""Look at the way he treats me,"" shit,
look at the way you treat me
See you and your lil' nosey ass homegirls got ya ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left the straddlin', ride this thing on out
And you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about, jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, and to the D and the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing that same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do

Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filing the world surrounding me

When I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
So much is left for us to see

When I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me

All the children of the world
Pretty yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight

And everybody's beautiful in an own way

There is none so blind
As He who will not see
We must not close up minds
We must let our thoughts be free

For every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that people lies
In the eyes of the beholder

And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children
Everybody's beautiful in an own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care about the length of His hair
Of the color of His skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within

And we're gonna get old again now
Everything is gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the look on the good side my friend
And spittle in out in your mind

And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children

Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself

Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here,? cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me

""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""

And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
And it's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together

Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walking hand in hand
In a wishful memory

Oh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be

Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back
Until the day I was born

And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that
I'd be yours from now on

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else

They're talkin' 'bout this famous place, down Greenwich Village way.
They hootenanny all the time with folks from everywhere, 
Come Sunday morning, rain or shine, right in Washington Square.

An' so I got my banjo out, jes' sittin', catchin' dust, 
An' painted right across the case: ""Greenwich Village or Bust!""
My folks were sad to see me go, but I got no meanin' there.
So I said, ""Goodbye, Kansas, Mo. And hello, Washington Square!""

Near Tennessee, I met a guy who played 12-string guitar.
He also had a mighty voice, not to mention a car.
Each time he hit those bluegrass chords, you sure smelled mountain air, 
I said, ""Don't waste it on the wind. C'mon to Washington Square.""

In New Orleans, we saw a gal a-walkin' with no shoes, 
An' from her throat there comes a growl, she sure was singin' the blues.
She sang for all humanity, this gal with raven hair.
I said, ""It's for the world to hear, C'mon to Washington Square.""

We cannonballed into New York on good old US 1, 
Till up ahead we saw the arch, a-gleamin' bright in the sun.
As far as all the eye could see, ten thousand folks was there, 
And singin' in sweet harmony right in Washington Square.

Say how's about a freedom song, or the ole' ""Rock Island Line""! 
Or how's about the dust-bowl crop, or men who work in a mine?
The songs and legends of our land is gold we all can share, 
So come and join us folks who stand and sing in Washington Square.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009306908000000001,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/pxoAN+x2K6CbnGdp/BeWJ1+9FDL6PTgecAM1zLOuMwoZa6XgCy2xOvUN481houcbFAqLAhgjxzUB1BD+nxtbW3DryJemrT2tu1uAgHTuILf45pocYA5yYGYi9jaeWCb1PWQBWSyD4tR4izQUcLsufQPXYnkbhMCkdNb0AncwcCQhT1kt0m6eLRxtdS1pzDIf5yY+YUqHFqSsJcdYY8QNPYOyG2o61JzXj3yrGeHh2zv0mcIWK8RQ7Xo1M/5B1NtIg9IrBmBZVajBumIbEmer3F8pWnD0pNx5KmM/K3u4UqK0FVOG6X7UvEWYv4PLs0eVDCcmitH+hq/8H6oFK6lUueNZ0dlLJBOWLWX4SSXhl7sGwmscTjWPER7WCC+UDpNNd6WwT16S4BRLNn6Le8BnPd+JnFrIWVi7X4/q6z2vUwU=/,4982006.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ny9Ijt8+dax1e2a9xnku/yTmXXxBl9EbGp3CB4RUu1ijqUzqCIeXkw31ZsBZrV3peWMgsRiTEBNT3oTlatFXwYLXe3bCJbIcwqh9qSPXbEyCyH3t83z6cHqWfMbxyv8Z1DxlsJQnWS5UnBtl6ctYtrnX0Fnfj34IyIxuAfZxanHhU3Rs+koi1bqxRXQH09I5h6tNDzx5UgCq2GBpk2Cr+8ohAG+BxU47XtrxW1MiM66HyC2qawjeKa4wC8shFTHzWL+g0sf7TeJfUix52+aho7TInOc2zBAh5A2rXbo5brEd2kVqZq6clvYKofv/MAdfPYOJJwrO9JhXsR9Yy9zmAcsyhaySe0m7djF+pUy66F2yQq2dWK2XEOA8VQFq9ORF7jkI4cORbQzCnj2CpHDu6aFiRwpKqzSYLn7tgUob4Y0=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:52:28 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/EdWHuu2HQYALHV/4Vx7enFED8XsL6dq1wqaZuLRk+COr9bgiM3VctSDkLoesyMoJYUjN/ATdH1T637sQ3VgQpbiZB59lip+yEca6P0MRWmcwx9CAP8A1QrTry+ws2QNUXrrkUqF6bcMkMNzldCa/sIbKnCBughp+d0l1pz6s6S2N9tPDRvxn7H82m9pZdEnrgAffJmvs0NtcY+S7v2pguYN5orNIBKEwCDhH8d8izpfDPuDjgbARD73Pn1c2gx9Zq+ZHt1z+4msko+1BuYbOfriTNEL/WSgcNZri3FRm2wd8H4i/CzS60XTnfj+a0uzSoXaC1VhZi8PGegAi3PR+gUTRpS3d2yHLMkcj0FcYtTrUNIz1V3LzCbJSSqLHkYBF1JJGGJy9cKp+cFv1Fyhekros/1AJ+5tTAsM+sUKR2lU=/,200.0,2010-09-13T10:27:36Z,[],washington square,1963

I love being in love, especially when you have somebody you can communicate with.
I like only like the way you make me feel when you hold me, (Do you. Do you.) squeeze me,
Oooh, when you drive me right out of my mind.
But I like it when you understand some of the things I'm going through.
(Do you. Do you.) You see, I like it when we talk.

Setting up another day
Of people to meet

You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street

They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Miscellaneous
Change The World (with Eric Clapton, live)
by Tommy Sims, Gordon Kenney and Wayne Kirkpatrick

If I can reach the stars,
Pull one down for you,
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth:
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems.
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams.

And I can change the world,
I will be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.

And if I could be king,
Even for a day,
I'd take you as my queen;
I'd have it no other way.
And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made.
Till then I'd be a fool,
Wishing for the day...

That I can change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

I could change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.011179923999999999,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/FYsBaaVBVW6rpto9OIjk3GZITiDEkr3Az2c0jZcbfSSAPvdP2pxo+dto0FfVGVDPg/sCJl46iI31dyqOQU0qUmKneqx5KZcqc4LHEK+UvCFWJ1QAOyvEOq2GUL2+mFuFtL1iGZ0ydwc2Igxj93MKp9JrrDJHRDYo65llBSGsnugDTnMqMKsiXCZAcxQh/DzBrG1j3mntHuKr4YgsP9yEs6Q9UJo/JXjpeGKK57gTfLWY8Fs/sUUJyL13zD0cPuC1XhfoZYVuu0ONI0JHeGrOFaMNxuipkZujfOfxp98DdfTP8aft98sITpnmeT7U/zUIX469t5BH1c6H1cu3CC3Xvi6DCowdsffZeg2bCVuhWbEAPfWaZdJf+Uw66gZf/upbvyjdMooScjhL7NxSQBEE9oqUDZhQZuRVYB3Oo3PXyBY=/,6650305.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/rie+vjf4pDZVQ4Euf58c1mQJtq0QwBKmYvePPHz7h4bO+i3XuQVpZZ/ZMdL6YiuJw9iksKMkrU6GbEWDuFZAsmKneqx5KZcqc4LHEK+UvCFWJ1QAOyvEOq2GUL2+mFuFPu8ttKMM7hTdjQEl5yYD3Zu7dmJ/zVZyJ15FQbzlm1DFQ5I3dlnoUh/NqZDtUt4pbqyqjpB4Jk0LRS8GVoA0cPEdTYXvGaOBq9IExG/xwblBkjtjZVB4nVjCMxR/6yg4qecGUdDz9+kRkmWfQ1V+jpLMnKvrxxIx262TFdyUNTwYLmyqkaTzjSSQCHzv6M/vqmrzOXXe99CmIA8jClMv2x8wiijSShIu8B+oek0LsjlFyA/r+Wk24fmbxuOyCoe/nnzB+EfUrphGUfnCm9NapCGrJduGehMT0FaMyzdLzM8=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:32:40 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/6SAF+SRkZuv3ZO/iuTQpAib2nIVuQB50xqXZ6P3BRouUsXu/uKRgyzTcfjeYuaoMu69xGrJj0diWb17OyQPh1m5XSFeYgChXHEqMWIT8spwBzNMk75oJqbkR4fPYJpbNSSuB4bNe2EPfsaxjxxMc3sgrsG/+CuQPwsdoXDEb9kutfLcdXxr3x2jUU6F1jN7X/UYHaHvis4a717qlaTV7mJCG5tjqQtsiUeqmTb6rrEY2wVjfYqnvPJYYfJQRmxBKaBknY3hVy+b9KInxAHiac9Som8jNtQbsXrF4BYNEzCHbR9l+dEJZa1szUQVp7R4Z04qwecE+QXZTHYNljzYP4Mzr9iTEQV9CiIKkGcevtLE1BwYNjfQoPTNfXQUTyuUJpGcc3ULQbWIXTsfIsV5uNmtf0DJMKFNm3IO7YQwiJ1s=/,200.0,2011-08-03T12:14:14Z,[],remember (the first time),1989

""My baby"" by Lil' Romeo
You got that

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

They call me lil' P, I represent the CP3
Calliope ya heard of me, straight from New Orleans
Gotta Uncle named Silkk and a Uncle named C
I been dribbling the ball since the age of 3

I got game like Coby, dunk it like Poppa P
Once I'm in the zone ain't no stoppin' me
'Coz you can jumpa baby humma girls be jockin' me
Them Miller boyz wear No Limit gear from head to feet

It's like that whodi, you got me crazy
It's like that whodi, I want to be your lady
It's like that whodi, why won't you be my baby
It's like that whodi can't no girl fade me
Meet me at the skatin' rink

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

11 years old, makin' A's and B's
And these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
When you see me in the streets holla, ""What's up doc?""
I gotta a bugs bunny chain wit a matchin' watch

I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife

I got grown women wanna be in my life
By the time I reach 18, I'm not gon' be nothin' nice
I'm that R O M E O, and after high school
I'm goin' straight to the pros bounce, bounce

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

Soldier boy I want you to myself I don't want them girls around
Your the flyest thing up in here boy and that's why it's goin' down
I heard they call you Romeo well I'm your Juliet
You must be playin' hide and seek 'cause boy you hard to catch

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

Why you boys make them elbows swing?
Why you girls make them elbows swing?

Romeo gonna do dat thang, Romeo gonna do dat thang
Romeo gonna do dat thang, Romeo gonna do dat thang

Why you boys make them elbows swing?
Why you girls make them elbows swing
Why you boys make them elbows swing?
Why you girls make them elbows swing

Throw 'em up, get 'em up, throw 'em up, get 'em up
Throw 'em up get 'em up what

This is for the fly girls that punk them
This is for the fly boys that punk them
This is for the fly girls that's 'bout it'
This is for the fly boys that's 'bout it'

Make 'em sweat, make 'em sweat
Make 'em sweat, make 'em sweat

Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I Have Nothing
Nothing
Nothing, if i don't have you (you-oo, you-oo, you)

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love (mm.)
uhh, I never knew
Love like I known it with you
Will our memories survive?
uhh, One I can hold on to

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go

Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

And as it fell you also claim it.
It was dark and I was all right,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me.
My hands they're strong, but my knees were far too weak,
Stand in your arms without fall into your feet,
But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.
All the things you say that where never, where never true,
And the games you play, you always, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touched your face,
Let it burn while I cry,
Cause I heard it screaming at your name, your name!

When I'm with you I could stay there,
Close my eyes, feel you're here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better!
Cause there's a side to you that I never, never knew,
All the things you say that where never true, never true,
And the games you play, you would always, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touched your face,
Let it burn while I cry,
Cause I heard it screaming at your name, your name!
I set fire to the rain
And I feel lost into the‰Û_
And it felt something nice,
Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
Even that when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for you.

I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touch your face,
Let it burn when I cry,

Trying to keep it just like before

So what? I keep thinking to myself

To the rush of day,
When the heat of a rolling wind
Can be turned away

An enchanted moment,
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight,
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone,
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn

There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

Well what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?
Yes honey, I love him, he is fine,
he does a lot of nice things for me I know he used to do nice stuff for you,
but what has he done for you lately?)

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancin' 'til I thought I'd lose my breath
Ahh
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?

Ooh ooh ooh yeah

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you, no way

You ought to be thankful for the little things,
but little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it,
You played it, you played it to the beat",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.01009798,1.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/KFA4n3sxEaHK4Owy4DxmKYpVpbv5bz5gYZJIIvuAVnrlLp3PzcqEfz1K7hFQddQH5qgXHk1Hs6dUHQRTXK/nly6abCcZFqkyp+NpTnF9v8x4WkVSspPVVTf+RGFMfoLC8Otf16HrXSFRF9/sEdsHkWs5jRYgfszElxlgwNQDhLKjjAcmDyMr6fjvxvM++cyvEhOWO8XTXsHF5m5xxCBht/8myHvlcyIhsC+S6HuHB21hnG5dSaR1HwxxIjmI/4H5Nx6zAxFTORe6mk9TJKflRdf2c54DYJOTkDLtOyVCX6ykjt9EU9TgU1FSOEhkjLjGhuDO8Pouz/4KkpHipYArYE3Ig5JplJTuObNNyyvyYTW02Vm1D2vei2JTHShCneMkszYMGsWkBr1tjw+EjduAKDnSEClVQvn8Ur9qkLgejjw=/,9664273.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/SNFXgRazGWRpk5QwDLzwdt4MANFMBxDFm47nAb+/75epuBLuEGNTH0sRw/Iu4SDKt3xSTqWei4VY8PzyAtE7l5Qb8YTXJFTg0pwLS7rcWEyIHDPi+pHwG+hLrXvYex9CKfFtblP/iU5Q5RV6a4wLp4jQbmSSJnx7W9BwNMIWOAkp7UmFzHBtymzEX6fzl3W3XSvkFfQYPM/1dF1K4/7mZJt9OmsKFgXbAQgvhOx/FskyH2pQejo2v7sMRyuWauo/xezeCbuV8yDiVkddLcchn+/q0lLefkPOg0SOir1O3G47aMS1XoHhjmry6aBKC84xv1SUFPYimaPcHKvmDPpOD9PMTq+5DOXOY+oTL+J3bmifejKz/94uTUXT1g2frW2kssr34XpG9GGwmt8r4hOULFs4X0VfABX9cQPnmd54A1A=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:16:10 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/LeQg9hzujZFbEpbJQGP3evaIeVtIDaiU16Hfkzk0zz7VqJatwesV9r63aJsytxiDWPzI2cFFYNNoYgU6Hr6SjSS5FWcASwC3MF+r35w2314uJ1a/9dL+e98Ql7628kvILHhSd6vZ5/SGGHfbqpnwTPLQPZ1BXiw6rLsb8H8FDZgEg0K41FConZKFZMvyrXC271/mMQnbizbHWY/9b6W8W8JLrzubGu9ad8KP5tOroGTwozMbrA0CpHhOdwoUoiUdJeDzOCfBwlOA5WXowuP6ILQSIb7bLCrOBrtZ+CMOhyZ0TrADLRV0gD22/WcSNf8vu8gsBBF3rrtQLyleLyPgrq4M80wze2VHOvo2HqgZuAwvoM8ip5ijhgQo/bFYZ9nTSBWRk1k4CB3rlz88+fLMGFWEZ7D6K0ASBPMQEH+NVG8=/,200.0,2014-06-25T07:57:45Z,[],rolling in the deep,2011

you said you aren't home much anymore
i stopped dropping by without an appointment
cause i'd hear laughter coming through your door.
Sometimes late at night you'll still call me
just before you close your eyes to sleep
you make me vow to try and stop by sometime
baby that's a promise i'can't keep.
I love you too much to ever start liking you
so let's just let the story have an end
i love you too much to ever start liking you
so don't expect me to be your friend.
I don't walk down through the village or other places
that we used to go to all the time
i'm trying to erase you from my memory

you smile that way you take my hand and then

is gonna catch up with your heart

Make you a dreamer, beliver, believin in love

Right when a man's, doin all that he planned
and he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver, a shot that will shiver him
drivin him down to his knees

Make him start giving, living, livin again

Well it's your mind, that tricks you in believin everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well it's your heart, that talks you into stayin where you are
Love will turn you around, turn you around

Out of the blue, she reaches for you,
and you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast, but you know it won't last
cause you can't get her off of your mind

Toughts are burnin, turnin, they're turnin around

How do you know, when to stay or to go
and how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign, to make up your mind
you got your heart at the wheel

You wanna start sharin, carin, carin again

Well it's your mind, that tricks you in believin everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well it's your heart, that talks you into stayin where you are

There's no storm yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine

I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine

What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel

Oh why why why why oh

Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The water shining on his skin,
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can't wait to share with him

I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him

I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you, bringing us near
And tell me
When will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

Time in New England took me away
To long rocky beaches and you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me
When will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

I feel the change coming, I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring, I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I had
With you there's a heaven so earth ain't so bad

about the crash you have on me?
Oh baby
I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it

But I wanna believe what they see.
I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend.
I keep showing emotions not knowing

just where it all stands for us.
From time to time I wonder what I am in your heart

And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark.

I'm lost in emotion

am I a fool 'cavse I don't know just how you feel?
And is my love for you? Oh
I can't conceal.

With big emotions - I can't be dealing - I wanna be with you -
But I don't know how - in my heart

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te diso te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo

El dijo que te ama

In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said see you later

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (East coast)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (West coast)

Oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Mi contar esperanza
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (South side)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (World wide)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (Open up your eyes)

Maria you know you're my lover
When the wind blows I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we are apart
It still feels like we're together
Oh Maria, yeah

She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
Oh, she fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar,
Played by Carlos Santana

Put 'em up y'all

Lonfellow Serenade
Such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady
And I was a dreamer
With only words to trade
You know that I was born for a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely
And she was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight

Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade

Longfellow serenade
Such were the plans I made
But she was a lady
As deep as a river
And through the night, we stayed

And in my way, I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more
For she was lonely
And I was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make you dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave this web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time

Loving you makes life worth living

Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

[""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977) soundtrack]

Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

I wasn't looking but somehow you found me
It tried to hide from your love light
But like Heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do?

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best

She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV
She needed someone with an interior smile

She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Is this love worth waiting for?
Something special, something pure

I wanna enjoy the luxury of like, 
not knowing each other for real. Hol‰Ûª up

Lotus flower bomb, firefly
When I‰Ûªm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love


Flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I‰Ûªm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that‰Ûªs why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil' vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend be your nigga or a friend with perks
I‰Ûªm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I‰Ûªm just tryna read your mind, I‰Ûªm just tryna feed you mine
I‰Ûªm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

We‰Ûªre living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It‰Ûªs feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can‰Ûªt you see?
I‰Ûªm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby?

Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you‰Ûªre Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don‰Ûªt need no rush
Don‰Ûªt believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you come in tri‰Ûªs
I just think we need one night, can‰Ûªt decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain‰Ûªt right
I ain‰Ûªt thinking I ain‰Ûªt right, can‰Ûªt decide but I can‰Ûªt fight
Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine

Or at least try, can I speak up? Was it peace out? Can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots with your flavor, flat drinks we call A cups?
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it‰Ûªs done right
With that gorgeous face, I don‰Ûªt know your name, it ain‰Ûªt important babe cuz imma call you Mine

We‰Ûªre living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It‰Ûªs feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can‰Ûªt you see?
I‰Ûªm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby?

Cuz you don‰Ûªt know who, you don‰Ûªt know when
If I keep stickin‰Ûª baby, what‰Ûªs it gonna be
You don‰Ûªt know who, you don‰Ûªt know when

Fade into the cold night
Don't know where to turn
Don't know where to turn
And all the dreams you're dreaming
Seem to lose their meaning
Let me in your world
Baby, let me in your world

All you need is someone you can hold
Don't be sad, you're not alone

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

In this world of strangers
Of cold, unfriendly faces
There's someone you can trust
Oh there's someone you can trust
I will be your shelter
I'll give you my shoulder
Just reach out for my love
Reach out for my love

Call my name
And my heart will hear
I will be there, there's nothing to fear

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

You said you'd be here by 9
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit, tryin' not to cry
Askin' myself why, you do this to me

Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me

Now I see, that you've been doin' wrong
Played me all along and made a fool of me baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheatin' on me, baby how could u do it to me

Damn them chicks wit chu gotta be your kin
Babe pretty thick wit the kick that's sick that need to be hit

You like that, huh?
Remember me?
Let's get roudy
Let's ride
Yeah, yeah
Yo, Montell when you walk
They be goin' to the lobby ya'll
Tell the bellman I need some more towels up here
When you see shorty?
The one that's sittin on them 20's?
Tell him in 504 she's still 'bout me, you heard?
Let's get roudy

You know Montell's 'bout it, 'bout it
Master P's 'bout it, 'bout it

Stepped in the club
After my show
You know the spot
Where everybody's on the low low
That's when I saw her
She saw me
She told me she like Master P
And Montell occassionally
So I laid back
Put a $50 in my mouth
Said I wanna see you shake it girl
Cuz that's what that 'bout it, 'bout it's about
All the nigga's in the club
Was jealous of me
Cuz I waited for it and I stayed for
And I'm damn near 'bout to pay for it
So

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

Let's Ride
Tonight
Can't do without it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I won't deny, babe
Girl I wanna ride it

Now baby what's more than incredible
She did her thing
5'5"" 146, Swinging nothing but a g-string
Her chocolate lips and
Sexy thighs
Sittin' properly up on top of me
She's riding, ain't no stopping me now
She bounced back
Then rocked slow
Like she's auditioning to kick it in my video
There ain't no limit
To what she'd do
I'm listening, she's whispering
Her girl wanna ride me too

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

She's moving up and down
And round and round tonight
Moving up and down
And around and around
She's moving up and down
And round and round, let's ride
Oh baby ain't nothing like the real thing

See us soldiers do it wild
I could make you smile
Make my nine go pow
Put on your boots let's run some miles
Camouflage on them sheets
Make that head board squeak
Up and down 'till you weak
Cuz us thug like a feak
Sixty eight will be my code
If you 'bout it girl, let's roll
I told you was no limit
Cuz tonight anything goes

Anything goes, let's roll
Lemme help you take up off your clothes
Give me a preview before
And the rest after the show
Thug love mixed with cream
Hennessey, strawberries, and Moet
Champagne, mo' in the bath havin' a hot tub
Drop a foot off a Oriental Rug
Can't get enough
You on top of me
Me on top of you
Do what you want to this thug
Girl ain't no stopping you

Let's ride
All night
I don't doubt it
Your love is 'bout it, 'bout it
And I'm so excited
Girl, I wanna ride it

Coming to breakfast
Go tomorrow
Yeah, I'm coming wit you
Me and Silkk, fool

Told ya'll there wasn't no limit

Carelessly I risked my love and my life.
There's no self-pity.

I pretended to be blind.
Fate has survived all the doubts I summoned.
My heart has stood all the failure and loss.
Helpless, I cannot further be driven.

Says, ""I'm home""
Beware of the look in his eyes
They tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be times when he won't say a word
And you wonder if there's something you said
The gentle touch of your hand
Tells him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you?
When he reaches out be there
Show him that someone cares
He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your arms

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Exactly how I feel

That real lovers do
So maybe we are better off

Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.008244038,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/H34wB1KHeq+N5OdOsFq/98DI32oQOcZZifdCgD/zL+TUB8dDzYcVmfHu4G1wzqWJsa0CKgMQBTksGoz3Do9/tuTLcvRxS2425jsdEftmAvKbCzg/aUNz4FzZYwrAkW5lmTWOkEv/KXNuTG2RruF0zCrRuPEJnjaj8+giOSmWGLTtyJOAaThTIsd8qT0gbXqTC7tLOY+L2PKsr+rsj4QO9rBdJyBZzwin/XgduxsGevbM9xcwgzKJZTCUwtnW/KEswMZpU6Nl220ZvNvUsj7aHrsHDt/MLZo/o42Pkfv7zT/bZQmMkmxAOP+jia/Jt3XK7CxwXvOZ7tlQkj/R+OwL/yN/b34yjcYFgPoP9KOGl3R63o0FMLNI9XIrTgUfndBcOWbxuEbgj/vhPrCh2E3GAsCfmnVKVZfGZF9GjUbbU48=/,1539257.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/Gktro3TeSzlinSfx6Dd6gWhl8w/Sm2ltUuKFL79DuBzJFIdXtci7xjsHsrhyPJ4cFDI51/d74fKDeVJlI7kI1Aw+Z0uQgvaJGkCfr6urb8mDhtSRoqAoy+74AaDVdxS09NRq5GjiunVM77ghHWBV2icx8pXwP0ZRdJ79wyk2ap2G9rUy+nhHAliE5q/fNPeLDSulYMxF6hLKokYN7fLxo8MbLGjHXUdngYzdCsAYFKYIAiNExmqRBSmwTa+NrCIUgz7WacuxuXYoeKkaYbPCNUODwJMUIZhFgmBBq/5HPdA4d25LjkWGcNxWSxA9JUSEjLep69ja36AJSUGMsBQtMTVRVOgPA8WQA2xSfu7CDtqNCsTINOcpMszfNtHpPJx27lfrJqSbHcNGCvdl8r8xvUIia3iZetdOgsSG/bFQwHE=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:00:03 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/PP/6GivE4XX9k+vgG8E+8JiumG4hrUjVvvoDSXxKmCKoR6wTMYsxXZl5/pQJyj3G9H7rF+XXBQzGyledpaIb0rEsUBvne/JbeM8fY119poGBDTsn8Or0xKPoh4j2DPsaFzMNsrpyK9cYaIcVLJYNUrPbQX/6F/yLkuArIKhpg+dOM9DJ3SVH14jcWVIeQO0m6G3vKYD8DTnHnsDsITX42B721vAJ7oMSObszIX9GSxEbePbCafmSK849dKPWrrcCySBzAXgq+vU5KOXCak0GO+xbFNWDI+6BeOH31EhQSU5lFCXVdg8L++uPQ/VfVt06ZVOkMz89Koe370U7GxlInSpcwFzJ8OT9x1ZslbXHs66/Po8hSSrQb42c7VbKwjuRRth2zpl4fOaMlkBrpXk+OuB1U8dEgIBTqrXnfhWf9/s=/,200.0,2010-11-07T19:42:05Z,[],"too much, too little, too late",1978

You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up

You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need
She knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin' up them deuces
I told you that I'm leaving
Deuces

I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finnin' throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work

You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't gettin' no reply

Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip, but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to

I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for? I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work

You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow

The other chick I'm with never complain
She make wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles

I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me dÌ©jÌÊ vu

And all that attitude, I don't care 'bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear 'bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work

You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.009737015,1.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/1s+FcEycRBCDpXYI1A+Q+i27HeGyLY0BxQOSrDzaYgzcNIMgyciwd/HTJrVsUmgp43YZqedAclkmQyvQKU3mH+y3QYd8ye6pfK0hP/l2U0aYxoSjO6vs3OgsmeHQJIsEvtsS9scZde4upk2uerwL8Rhne/lmJuYZP2TKxO5TxAXtyNOI+NZo1aQnwq5PqAKOpVcLElB5JpysXF5p3EO/gWctB53ScgPVMlGLK3HoVbzUswz7BCNtWYcSp/khOUCXcGTumnIDIaytAene1ZBBStd6ViUCrTnsf1F3zo41+xm896ly36iaO+dS8Tr6OnYvH+IIXcn0LVyjaVZbhVRGMcXVdorSffJCSpgd9Er+aDSgDtUIZ4riBSqGjiOp77Ak/,8799621.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/wd3DIIHgTlHtFGxQjtkpdTVTbXIDxl8CuBv9PVLu68E3xXk8qS52cZS9OV9Yod8MsneN/2imzdFwBzXhX0hDwzL+qc8Trk1I2x48sbHTWmq2GZJ6S9A/HMsC8CkBDUQuXygpNuTxIr99ql2dOhUVATgv6PAJ7/KAmua3E1V/eq0m07fdE1mWnuENQ3/4vyuy/IJI5jUhhhnT/3MTSoPZTDlsz/oI9WF3EDaGfVqI9ZH75vvU7ZjPhVzUp+QberrPwOJTXtnKEdxfXRC/ANggL6RWcmrzZ5iQwT91DQR9pRKauXwQe5RanJisKx/SPyb7NorKohQFd6UNSMu4zE/k/c+TGiHnXI4wv6Hrr3zMPtNzNW/bEM0RLn8U2bxlznm//,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:44:44 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/2iHLgIDxTNMKOxY6Sv7hgnNGp8V4zQHbqJuhT4PUlxaDsvt4uYjT3dMEY9to+owCOkXjmPaUUSZGGiWo9JYbSijFYGMKm6dMFCDHNrr4aopQtHEuqV3qTrvCC6kHcDW6IVIjqADJh4+qi4Fhs8qgXxDZ2EoHrbbrjdbMWy7T8KVVtf2NbrmH5g85LxRR/L5dURbsvgcdwdi2VWlEExcxAKyhJqr57ZKiSPG6o65fdoERUKabgyAYFBTKdDxjwIYT5NZUfLvCwtCLhARPND1VOaNMP/xSYuhahx0atIUYb5Laoimpxhjk8QwW/8qHy2tp7aILxKScZkPcjPxO04ScN/MWdvx7Sxxp43kaK4+7CZZ4ZS05eKPHHGXK5ww5QtRu/,200.0,2013-12-17T07:41:17Z,[],deuces,2010
