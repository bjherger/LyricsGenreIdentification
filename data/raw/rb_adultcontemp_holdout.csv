I had a dream I had an awesome dream 
People in the park playing games in the dark 
And what they played was a masquerade 
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

That's the way it should be

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two 
A helping hand - Some one who understands 
That when you feel you've lost your way 
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you"" 

Say you, say me
Say it for always 
That's the way it should be 
Say you, say me
Say it together

So you think you know the answers - Oh no 
'Couse the whole world has got you dancing 
That's right - I'm telling you 
It's time to start believing - Oh yes

That you would take my heart and run

Lead me to want some real love

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true and oh baby, I thought that your love was true
I thought you were the answer to the questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel

Now, I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all

Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)
Richer than Richie, till you niggaz come and get me

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

Wreck it buy a new one
Your crew run run run, your crew run run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga wit

So get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (that's right!)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin

Leave that ass leakin, like rapper demo
Tell them hoe, take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em wit the force like Obi, dick black like Toby (Obi, Toby)
Watch me roam like Gobe, lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe show me, homey. (say what, homie?)

Something's telling me some bullshit is going down

Is it someone else
My vitals' telling me you're creeping
Finding numbers in your jeans
You're talking in your sleep
Faded letters written by me get o-u-t

2 - No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more staring at the phone
'Cos I can do better by myself

Yeah, it's obvious how things have changed within the year
Just give me half of the rent and get out of here
No more talking save your lying for somebody else
Keep on walking 'cos I can do better by myself

that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out...

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why...
On that morning
When this life is over
I know, I'll see your face

Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)

Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every time I pray (we miss you)
I'll be missing you (we miss you)
Thinking of the day (we miss you)
When you went away (we miss you)

What a bond to break (we miss you)

Listen.
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie.

A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love, I wasn't sure that I was.
it's been a year-Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall.
But being without you just aint livin' aint livin'at all
If I could travel back in time, I'd relive the days you were mine.

As a young, it was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick named me, Cook Coke Shit
Should've been called Don Robbery
Extortion or maybe grand larceny

I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with shoty was the logo kid

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

R to the e'zzy', M to the whizz I
My arms stay breezy, the don's stay flizz
I got a date at eight, I'm in a seven forty 'fizz I've
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die

With a matchin' jacket 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance or boogie
So never mind how we got in here with the weapons and hoodies

Listen we don't pay admission and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it

Said he like my necklace, started relaxin' now
That's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga,
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game nigga

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelin's

Your can find Joe crack at all type of shit
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit
If I woulda brought Compton, they'd prolly squeal
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like Derick fo' real

If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These fagot niggas even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up

Kay keep tellin' me to speak about da rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about da rucker
Not even pee wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the roc away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Uh, Big punk forever, to more terror forever

(verse 1: Petey Pablo)
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there
I'm the truth
I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
Cause they seen me do it
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back, pickin' out baskets of fruit
(I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freaky Petey loves you too
Ha, ha
You know how I do

(Ciara)
You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for
Sexy, independent, down-to-spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

(chorus)
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Maybe cause I talk about it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

(verse 2: Ciara)
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You think you're slick
Tryn'a hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

(chorus)

(verse 3: Petey Pablo)
So damn hot, but so young
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the bag
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam da bam

(verse 4: Ciara)
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryn'a get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
Don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oeh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it all away
When you think you're in love

What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been.
I don't wanna swing your change

But you know they've heard it all before

You toyed with my affection

I had to set you free.

'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to

I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'

I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond

Walk into the club like ""What up? I got a big cock!""
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like ""Damn, that's a cold ass honky!""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no

They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't

She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time

She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there

Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away

Where people saying: ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""

Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
A beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
It may be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you feel
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of this straight line

There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escape them one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you feel
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel

And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Mmm, on a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong

So where was the passion when you need it the most?
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

â€˜Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

You had a bad day, you've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time?
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Had a bad day
Had a bad day

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Two bottle of whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?

It's got sights to give you shivers

Scattered the rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
â€˜Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
â€˜Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar...

Snow is falling as the caroles sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight

You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need

Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars, yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
